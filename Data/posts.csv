jenselter,"Happy Sunday babes! ? I wanted to share some advice for those of you feeling frustrated from not seeing the progress you'd like to see. Self-appreciation and self-gratitude is so important and the mental and emotional component of loving and appreciating yourself is just as powerful as working your butt off in the gym. It's easy to feel defeated and angry if you skip a day at the gym or if you have an extra cheat meal. It happens to every. single. one. of us. But that's OKAY! Don't get angry or too hard on yourself, you're human. Instead, love, empower and applaud yourself for working as hard as you do, eating clean regularly and taking care of your body. Exercising, fueling your body with nutrient rich foods and taking mental health days is necessary for a healthy and happy life. And remember to love yourself! Because at the end of the day, why are you taking care of your body? To look and feel good! So remember that as the ultimate goal and always find time to love yourself. You're absolutely beautiful...the rest of the world sees it and you need to take the time to see it for yourself too! xoxo",2017-09-11T00:20:05.000Z,Monday,11500000,167,0,False,https://www.instagram.com/p/BY4WE7Uhl4G/?taken-by=jenselter,0,1018,291385,night

humansofny,"“My first time was October 18th, 2013. I was a freshman in college. I was alone in my dorm room and I’d just eaten a bunch of Halloween candy. So I purged it. I felt great afterward. I thought I’d discovered a new tool. It seemed like a way to stop gaining weight. But it became very powerful, very quickly. My second time was two days later. Soon it became most meals. I became addicted to watching the numbers drop. I lost all power over it. I was dizzy and depressed all the time. I couldn’t focus in class or go out with friends. For five months, I lost all control. Then I finally got help. I started talking about it. And the more I talked about it, the more control I got back. The eating disorder lost its power when it stopped being a secret. I’m much better now, but I’ll always be recovering. A few weeks ago I had a relapse. It was the first time in months. Even though I was disappointed, I reminded myself that it wasn’t the end of the world. I haven’t lost all the progress I’ve made over the past four years. I just need to stay positive. And keep talking about it.”",2017-09-11T19:49:03.000Z,Monday,7200000,77,0,False,https://www.instagram.com/p/BY6b2tIg9GQ/?taken-by=humansofny,0,4302,108458,night

humansofny,"“My mother was sixteen when the war came to St. Petersburg. She was the oldest of four children, so her parents chose to evacuate her first. She was supposed to find a job and the rest of the family would follow. She was evacuated with a factory. The workers were on one boat and the machinery was on the other. The boat with the machinery was bombed and sank to the bottom of the river. My mother ended up in a city thousands of miles away. Sometimes there was such little food that she survived on grass. But everyone who stayed behind in the city died. Her entire family was killed in one night. Growing up, she always told us about St. Petersburg. She hung paintings of the city all over our house. So we wanted to bring her back here before she died. When we arrived in the city, we went straight to visit her old house. Only the foundation was left. But when we got off at the subway stop, the strangest thing happened. Two children came running toward us. Their mother was calling after them: ‘Sonya and Misha!’ They had the same names as me and my brother. It was as if they were greeting us.”

He started driving me home at night. We began dating and recently moved in together. But a few weeks ago I called his cell phone and a woman picked up. She started asking who I was, and said she wanted to know why I was calling ‘her man.’ Afterwards he told me it was a big misunderstanding. He said it was his ex-girlfriend, and he’d been with her for nine years, so he still feels a responsibility to provide for her. He swears it’s just a material relationship. But she calls him all the time now. He’s not my property, and I don’t want to lose him, but I just want him to make her go away. But he acts like it’s my problem. When I tell him it bothers me, he just says: ‘I’ll ask her not to call at night.’” (St. Petersburg, Russia)",2017-08-22T23:50:42.000Z,Tuesday,7200000,77,0,False,https://www.instagram.com/p/BYHXnCsAAMM/?taken-by=humansofny,0,4302,144036,night

Look at your Life. Look at the ways in which you define who you are and what you’re capable of achieving. Look at your goals. Look at the pressures applied by the people around you and the culture in which you were raised. Look again... And again... Keep looking until you realize, within your own experiences, that you’re so much more than who you might believe you are. We as humans tend to belittle our ambition and ourselves and that belittling brings down our drive and our self-worth. Moment by moment, day by day, year by year, we face a variety of obstacles that test OUR strengths, OUR faith, and OUR patience. Only allow the mind to think in the direction YOU WANT TO GO. It’s a process of getting so deeply rooted into THE CORE OF WHO YOU ARE that you are unshakable when the world around you tries to bring you down.

Jodica Roos won $5,000!! Great work girl *hair flip ?
.
Jodica Success Story: I used to compete in fitness competitions, after my last comp in 2015 I lost my ways and I blew out putting on 28kgs due to personal reasons. I started about 4 months ago I started to try lose that weight again, I was trying all crazy diets and programs trying to get back to where I once was. Nothing seemed to be working, I became very unhappy with the way I looked and often reminisce on the old days. You are hands down the best motivator I have ever come across so I knew your challenge would help me smash my goals. .
My biggest weakness is that I am a cake baker and I bake cakes every day, lucky for the healthy treat recipes you provided, they got me through those temptations! I have not missed a single session since I've started your challenge which was actually really easy to put in 100% when I had the right constant support. The workouts were a killer but very achievable to do and now I'll never look back and will be able to completely keep myself on track. .
Thank you so much for taking the time to make the perfect program for me, I followed the ebook, program/diet plan to a Tee! I am extremely happy with my results although the 5 weeks are now over I will keep pushing long after this challenge for the best I can be with a happier and healthier lifestyle. Losing 13.7kgs (30.2lbs) in 5 weeks is one of the best achievements I have ever made, thank you for giving me my confidence back and for showing me it is possible, giving me back my faith! I will be forever grateful.

chrisburkard,"One of the biggest issues I've had to overcome as a photographer that travels the globe is to learn awareness of the issues facing the places I love & have dedicated my life to documenting. I cringe to think of the times in my life where I've photographed something purely for its beauty while failing to mention that it's under threat & in need of protection. Which is why my work documenting Iceland's rivers have been more than just an artistic endeavor for likes. .
The latest issue that has been brought to my attention from the many passionate locals & incredible messages from people like you - is the potential for oil drilling in Norway's Lofoten islands as well as other neighboring locations.
I cannot express the beauty & importance of this wild place & as always I hope you do your own research & form an educated decision. If you have been inspired by this landscape then I urge you to speak out as the window to be heard is now.
.

Negotiations to open the area for drilling start after sept 11 & the fate of this landscape falls upon the
Norwegian prime minister candidates @jonasgahrs & @erna_solberg . Feel free to tag them in a comment expressing your position or express your feelings to them directly.

chrisburkard,"(Warning : Graphic) I reckon there is few people who can function artistically in intense & harsh conditions like @renan_ozturk . But even the best sometimes take a beating. In iceland while creating the aerial footage for 'Under an Arctic Sky' Renan & @taylorfreesolo were constantly dealing with dead batteries, frozen fingers & terrible weather. .

At one point I realized we had pushed the crew a bit too far. After an all nighter & a long 8hr drive we stopped briefly because the light was amazing & we wanted to put the Drone in the air... nothing happens fast with an 8 blade drone carrying a really heavy camera... In fact we dubbed it the 'flying chainsaw'. Through some mystery of events Renan's 900 down fill jacket accidentally engaged the blades of the drone while it was right near his face.. everything that happened next was a blur.. a huge cloud of down feathers went in the air & Renan karate chopped the drone back to the ground pushing Taylor out of the way. We could see slices in his jacket & pants & knew right away it wasn't going to be good.
.

Quick deliberation made us realize that he needed a hospital because these cuts were deep.. no amount of crappy eyebrow bandaids were gonna do it. Renan ended up with 25 stitches in his knees & couldn't bend his legs the rest of the trip. With an option to stay or go home opted to finish the trip creating what I think is some of the best aerial footage of Iceland I have ever seen. By far the most inspiring part of this film was working with people like this.

chrisburkard,"Almost 10 years ago I took on one of my first real editorial (magazine) assignments. Timmy Turner had almost lost his life fighting a deadly staph infection that had started chewing its way through his head. A routine training swim in Huntington Beach had led to a bad sinus infection... then a coma... and the last thing he remembers is waking up in intensive care with stitches in his skull.
A pro surfer & filmmaker that had spent most his life in remote tropical waves in the middle of nowhere had now been told by doctors that he was most likely never going to surf again.... well in warm water at least. So he decided to do the most logical thing & devote himself to only cold water where the risk of staph was almost non existent. He spent the next few years exploring Canada, Ireland, Iceland and more.
.

I knew Timmy as a friend shooting in California & all the sudden I found myself sharing a tent snow camping & swimming in frigid water with him & a crew in northern Iceland on assignment for Mens Journal. I had somehow led the photo editor (who's still a good friend) to believe I knew what I was doing. I was completely out of my realm trying to balance shooting a surf trip with portraiture amidst capturing his return to the ocean & filmmaking in an honest way. .

Today I still consider myself lucky to have been apart of that story... I learned more lessons that I could have ever imagined from Timmy & the whole team. Was I was the best person for the job? Probably not, but I realized I was willing to sacrifice & give more of myself shooting someone I respected & telling a story I cared about than anything else. @timmyturnerferal",2017-09-06T00:40:27.000Z,Wednesday,2800000,616,0,False,https://www.instagram.com/p/BYrgbsNAkR_/?taken-by=chrisburkard,1,2838,55508,night

chrisburkard,"Deep in the Reine Fjord, far from the road & popular photo pullouts, lies a village that is now only populated in summer. Our boat captain told us that in the old times an average days work for a fisherman would include rowing to the end of the Fjord, hiking over a pass, fishing on the sea in a boat hid away on a sandy beach and then hiking your days catch back over the pass & into the Fjord. As if that wasn't enough you would row a small boat from the back of the Fjord all the to the village market to sell your catch. This photo does it no justice at all. It's no wonder Norwegians were able to inhabit such raw environments... there's a level of sacrifice that seems unmatched when it comes to living in harsh places.",2017-09-03T21:29:03.000Z,Sunday,2800000,616,0,False,https://www.instagram.com/p/BYmA8JnAF3u/?taken-by=chrisburkard,0,2838,97608,night

SOLO MIAMI ? ¿Saben que es la Keratina de pestañas?
Es un servicio en dónde las pestañas se alisan, levantan y estiran suavemente desde la base, por lo que se verán visiblemente más largas y densas sin la necesidad de la aplicación de extensión de pestañas. Este efecto dura 50 días y se puede repetir en cualquier momento porque este tratamiento es suave y no daña las pestañas, más bien las endurece, les da fuerza, las levanta les da más volumen y longitud.
Y por tiempo limitado tengo este tratamiento en ¡Oferta! ???

livingonearth,"One of the most famous wrecks on Moreton Island in Australia is the Tangalooma Wrecks.
Photo by: @swaller4 ????
Fifteen vessels that were deliberately sunk to form a breakwall for small boats also creating an amazing wreck dive and snorkel site. Snorkelling and scuba diving at this site is an incredible adventure. The crystal clear waters provide fantastic visibility to view marine life and coral formations such as wobbegongs, trevally, kingfish yellowtail and an array of tropical fish.
The Tangalooma wrecks came about in 1963 as a result of lobbying by recreational boat owners for a safe anchorage. The wrecks consists of a line of old Harbours and Marine Department steam driven dredges and barges on the edge of a sandbank that were deliberately sunk with the Maryborough being the first vessel. Recently the tops have been cut off them and signs advising not to climb on them have been erected to make it a safer swimming environment.

The Wrecks are not far off the beach so it is possible to swim out to them if you are wanting to explore and have your own snorkelling gear, but be aware of the current that sweeps between the wrecks and the beach when the tide is running, don't try to swim against it, swim back and walk along the beach further.",2017-08-31T17:58:14.000Z,Thursday,1700000,212,0,False,https://www.instagram.com/p/BYd6bZWBeeL/?taken-by=livingonearth,1,437,27517,evening

•One of my biggest dreams is to live on lots of land with a giant garden, have lots of children and lots of animals.
•I haven't eaten meat -other than fish- in 6 months. •I'll be 26 on Wednesday.

blogilates,"""Be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to change you."" ? This week I wrote some blog posts and Instagram posts that really disappointed people - so much so that they publicly announced that they were going to unsubscribe and stop working out with me. And it showed. I lost hundreds followers the day I posted that motivational quote about not being lazy. Then I wrote a blog post about Taylor Swift and her new song (which was overall very positive BTW) but people got so mad at me for questioning the Kimye drama that they said they were ashamed of ever standing up for me when I was being harassed. I've been online for over 8 years now and I'm been subjected to all sorts of drama, lies, defamation, mean comments, hate speech, and death threats etc. But the ones that always hurt the most are the ones where I ""disappoint"" you guys. So right now, I'm feeling sad. ? And I'm questioning myself - should I not have said that?? I noticed that over the years I've had to really cut back on what I REALLY want to say in order to not be attacked. But in doing so, I feel like some of my blog posts and IG captions have gotten so vanilla...so wishy washy...all because I didn't want to offend anyone. But that's stupid, isn't it? Because I'm ALWAYS going to say something that someone's going to be upset about. As this fan base grows, so does the judgement of every single one of my actions. It's totally ok to disagree with me, and sure, unfollow me if our values don't align. I just need to keep reminding myself to BE ME. I don't mean harm. I mean well in all that I do. And if someone can't see my intention and they choose to shut me out of their life for one little thing I said that irked them, then I need to be OK with them not being in my life. Anyway, just wanted to let you guys know what's going on. Trying to get over this. Wanted to share. So posting some happy pics. #",2017-09-08T02:09:44.000Z,Friday,1400000,482,1,False,https://www.instagram.com/p/BYw0PaNB_-X/?taken-by=blogilates,0,4308,34144,night

I'm saying this not only as a reminder to you but also as a reminder to myself. Thank you for always reading my captions.

You can make a difference! For every person that comments and tags a friend on this post within the next 24 hours I will personally donate $1 for Hurricane Disaster Relief to @unitedwaymiami AND all funds will be matched dollar for dollar by @liforme ? We cap the limit at 10,000 comments and we hope to reach it!! Help us raise both awareness and funds for the people who are recovering from the devastation of Hurricane Harvey and Irma in the US and the Caribbean islands. United Way Miami is coordinating efforts to help communities recover and rebuild following Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. 100% of all donations to Operation Helping Hands will go directly to supporting response efforts. They will work with local United Ways and nonprofit agencies in the affected areas to support both immediate and long-term recovery needs.

As a native Floridian I've lived through many hurricanes (including the Category 5 Hurricane Andrew), but the level of destruction spreading across Texas, Florida and the Caribbean is astounding. It took my family months to rebuild and make our home habitable again after the eye of hurricane Andrew passed over us. And we were lucky because the roof stayed on our house. I know first hand how utterly hopeless so many hurricane survivors feel right now. My heart is breaking that I'm not in Florida and able to help the restoration efforts, but I hope to help in this way. I want to say this to everyone: You will get through this. You will rebuild stronger. You are not alone.

kinoyoga,"There sometimes seems to be an obsession with being the best and whole books are devoted to teaching you how to be a number one. It's like there's a false promise being made by the social contract that says if you work the hardest you'll get worth the most. Sometimes being overworked and exhausted is like a badge of honor in our fast-paced culture. Well, really, I've started to wonder why we are we obsessed with being the best and having the most. Perhaps it's because we think once we get to the top and we are surrounded by all we have, then we will finally be worthy and validated. Somewhere hiding in what appears to be a meritocracy is the idea that you'll earn your worth. You can earn respect, but worth is something else.
_
When we start yoga that yearning doesn't go away. You have to see it and recognize in yourself before it will shift. Usually in the practice the paradigm of more-is-better surfaces as the burning desire to ""get"" a pose and then another one and another one. We try to accumulate poses like material possessions under some idea that the more advanced the poses we have the better yogi (or person) we are. But it's that paradigm that needs to change.
_
Your worth is innate. You don't need to do anything to make it. It's already there. No matter how hard you try you'll never get all the poses. Even if you're the best at something for a little while, it won't be an eternal reign. Maybe what we need to learn is how to stop making kingdoms out of our desires. Then we can set ourselves free from the chains of I and mine and learn the beauty of us and we.
_
The solution isn't to stop practicing advanced poses or working hard at your job. The solution is all about your mindset. Do you do handstands because they bring you joy? Or do you do them because you're trying to prove that you're good enough?
_
Drop the fight. Live in love. Make peace with where you are. Let every action come rest in the simple truth of your worthiness.

kinoyoga,"Today was such a fun day that I forgot for whole moments that a giant superstorm is pointed at my home.
Hurricanes are awful because it's like watching yourself fall off a cliff in slow motion. You see this giant blob coming towards you like a supersize PAC-man and you and your home are like dots waiting to be eaten. I'm not sure what's worse, the anticipation of impending doom or the actual storm. But I do know one thing. Like any situation, no amount of stress or panic will help. In fact it may only make matters worse. All we can do is have faith. Whatever is destroyed will be built back even better. Whatever is spared will be cherished even more. Either way, we seek the refuge of grace, mercy and protection. We prepare the best we can and then we turn it over and surrender. We are only ever given what we can truly handle, so rest assured that if you don't feel strong enough to face what's in front of you, you will either be made stronger or you will get the help you need.

May grace, mercy and peace be with us all. #prayforflorida ?

kinoyoga,"It's surreal to be sitting in Europe with the heaters on and the cold rain outside when a massive storm is headed straight for my home. It takes every ounce of mental, emotional and spiritual strength not to flip out and obsessively update the projected path of the hurricane. So much of life is mental discipline. It's easy to let thoughts spin out of control and so much harder to reign in the mind to a state of balance. Love is the most powerful force in the universe. God is love. No matter how big that storm looks online remember that there is something bigger and stronger and you have access to it right now, deep in your heart. You are made of love. There is nothing that can destroy or harm the true light that surrounds you. Rest in faith, let that be a covering of spiritual armor. Pray for mercy, grace and peace. What is meant to be will be. All you can do is learn to love a little bit more. Maybe we all need to send Irma a big hug and say gently, hey girl, you don't need to spin that hard and fast anymore, tranquilo, you're loved and awesome and we see your power, you're good, would you please be nice and not flatten us? ?

kinoyoga,"Pray for everyone in Hurricane Irma's path right now. Pray that the storm weakens and shifts out to sea. Pray for our families, friends, pets, homes, businesses, beaches to all be safe. It's driving us crazy that we aren't home in Miami to prepare, but we have an amazing team of friends and family who are stepping up to help out on the hurricane prep mission. We love you, we miss you, we are praying for us all. I lived through Hurricane Andrew, one of the most catastrophic category 5 storms to make landfall in the US. My neighborhood was uninhabitable for months. A giant tanker ship washed ashore at least a mile from the coast in the storm surge. All but one window popped out of the house and there were fish on the lawn. The roof was damaged but it held. We were one of the lucky ones. Most others were flattened. I don't wish this storm on anyone. Pray for us all.
_
I believe in the power of prayer, in the attitude of grace and surrender. There is nothing we can't accomplish by the power vested in us, if only we learn how to live every moment with purpose. It takes a disciplined and trained mind to listen to the quiet voice of wisdom that speaks from the heart. Peace is a testament to spiritual fortitude and unstoppable resolve and it is the true core strength. We all make an impact on the world around us, perhaps more so than we realize. Practice gratitude and you will be grateful. Practice fear and you will be fearful. Practice love and you will feel love. Practice hate and you will hate. You decide. It's all in your power. You are bigger than anything you face and you have the powerful to move mountains with faith the size of a mustard seed. Just believe.

It struck me today that I've been feeling a bit in limbo lately. I simultaneously realized how busy I am at home and how much I thrive on doing things I love. It doesn't come from a need to prove anything, it comes from pure joy. I love to film so much so that when my husband asked me what I wanted to do for my birthday (it's not my birthday yet but I will be soon) I told him that I always like to be photographed or filmed. I always have, ever since I was a little girl. All you have to do to get me in a good mood is point a camera at me. I guess I like the attention, but I also just love the energy of it, the idea of creating something fun and real.

kinoyoga,"I've noticed something recently that I see both as a softening and a strengthening, but more than anything as a return to myself. It's like I got lost somewhere or rather I let myself be lead astray by voices that meant well but weren't my truth. And now I'm listening again, to the stillness, to the quiet, to the deep peace. The voice I hear is familiar, full of wisdom and compassion. I've been through a lot, and in a very sense, I'm still going through the thick of it. Some days I feel exhausted and overwhelmed by how much further there is to go, but how many miles I have yet my walk, by how tall the mountains are that I have yet to climb. But then I get to share a moment of joy and gratitude with a tearful student who said my presence made a difference in her life and it all makes sense. Or I read all the messages from everyone practicing with me on @omstarsofficial and my heart swells. Wherever you are in your journey, look for the love that surrounds you. Follow your inspiration, leave a little space between your goals, day dream without staring at your phone. Breathe some magic into all the moments of your life. Someone once told me that I could be as bright as I am intelligent. I think about that sometimes and I think it's the other way around, intellect is only worth something when it's filled with love and light.

kinoyoga,"Things change. And they often do in ways we can't ever possibly imagine. Big seismic shifts in the landscape come in like a deluge and despite your best planning there's no way you could have seen it coming. I mean this both in the literal, emotional, mental and metaphoric sense. Things that I have thought would never happen have happened, both good and bad. It can be overwhelming sometimes, the rapidity with which the tides turn. I've shed my skin a number of times and been reborn to a new life. Each time I lost a layer I became more myself. I'm not uncomfortable being alone, and yet, the more I tune in the more I value connection. Things change. People change. This moment is never same, it's always new, having died to the past in one instant and been born in the next to the future. There is both immense freedom and tremendous loss in that, as though time comes in and washes away the remains of yesterday to set you free to tomorrow, but it also carries something away with it. That something that got lost is perhaps a piece of yourself that you thought was vital, but really isn't even though you miss it. When big change hits you really see that it's not in your hands. You can't bring anything with you except the bare essentials, your heart, your memories, your soul, your spirit. And really, it's all you ever really needed anyway. Pick up the pieces, hang on tight, when it all lands be grateful you're standing on your feet, with air to breathe, with the sun shining, and with love yet still to give.

kinoyoga,"In the beginning when you're figuring things out it's normal and healthy to emulate others, to copy their movements and want to be like your mentor, your teacher, your older sibling. But someday you've got to break free and be totally your own. You've got to believe that who you are is enough and that you've been given the exact set of gifts that you need to succeed. There's a tune that only you can sing, there's a dance that's only in your soul, there are words that only you can write. Find yourself and be who you were meant to be, or rather become who you have always truly been.

kinoyoga,"The pieces of your life are like a puzzle being laid down one at a time. Don't rush it, let it take the times it takes. Every experience, every trial, every failure, every success, every high and every low--they are all vital components of the grand picture of your life. Maybe not now, but maybe in ten or twenty years when you look back and see the larger perspective you'll see the whole picture and understand what it is all about. There's no need to try and force the pieces that don't fit together. Maybe they belong to another puzzle and in order for you to finish your puzzle you need to let them go. There's no need to hurry and finish in a mad dash for some artificial finish line because this is all about your process. It's just about you being you, taking one step at a time on the journey of life, learning the lessons that make you who you are, in exactly the time that you need. I've had some hard lessons this year and I'm not sure where all the pieces are going to fall, but I can start to see the outlines of the story the pieces are starting to tell. I know it's about forgiveness, it's about faith, it's about never giving up and, like always, it's about love. It always really is.

What are your favorite things to do, now or in the past?

For me, I love anything that allows me to be #creative. It doesn't matter what medium is as long as I am creating. I studied ceramics, #fashion design, and photography in college. I was obsessed with sculpture for a time, even #creating many full size busts! I loved studying the human face and how symmetrical it is. For instance, did you know that the corners of your mouth line up with your pupils and your eyes are placed directly in the center of your head (not your nose)?! #sointeresting
_
I designed the #leggings ? I'm wearing to celebrate the launch of my new website but I don't feel like celebrating. As many of you know, we just went through Hurricane Irma. We lost power (which is why this post is late) but we still have our house. I feel so terrible for those people that have #lost everything so I'm donating 100% of the profits of my new leggings to #Hurricane relief.

beachyogagirl,"Day 1 #instagramworthy challenge! What makes you smile?
_
This prompt is really about joy. What in your life creates the most joy? For me, it's helping others. There is nothing that makes me feel more worthy than #service. Right now, as we brace for Hurricane #Irma, there isn't a lot of #smiling. All my ""things"" don't matter. What matters most is #helping my friends and #family secure their homes & have a safe place to go. We as people, need each other and being of #help to others in any way, is what makes life #worth living.
_
What makes you smile? Join this #challenge with @stoked_yogi and I to help you discover your #purpose for posting on Instagram! Join our LIVE Webinar on Sept 21 at 1pm EST to learn how to #GROW your online #community.

beachyogagirl,"We aren't guaranteed tomorrow so I'm appreciating this #moment, right now before Hurricane Irma hits my home. I'm cleaning my house like a mad woman & organizing things like I've never done before. Is this normal? I don't know but it makes me feel better.
_
Even though this storm (for me) looks more favorable than it did yesterday, I can't help but think about all those who have lost everything and those who are about to see their homes and businesses destroyed. It makes me appreciate what I have now more than I ever did before.
_
I'm lucky - I could rebuild if I had to. I have family support and opportunities that others don't. I'll be okay but for others, their entire country is destroyed. What do you do then? How can you start over? It's just so heart wrenching to see. Thank you for your prayers and thoughts, please keep them coming. So many people need them right now.

beachyogagirl,"I have to admit, I'm really nervous. #HurricaneIrma is no joke and we are taking this very seriously. For all who have asked we are not #evacuating for many reasons one being we live in a concrete house that is built to withstand hurricane winds of 125 mph and two, they haven't issues evacuations for my area. We also don't want to get stuck in gridlock during a hurricane as this storm is going to hit all of Florida - that would be the worst place to be and flying isn't an option as I would never leave @beachyogadog! Many friends have been stuck in their cars for hours already only to have moved a few hundred feet. We are all shuttered up as you can see from the #selfie and we have plenty of #water, gas, #food and a #generator. IF they issue evacuations trust me, I will leave but I feel pretty safe (as #safe as possible) here in my #home. Thank you for all the messages, #prayers and thoughts. Keep them coming - we need them! I love you guys and I'll keep you posted with #hurricane updates on Snapchat: .

beachyogagirl,"3 years ago I was practicing handstands at the beach when a bird landed on my foot for my most #epic photo to date. On a timer my #GoPro (by complete miracle) caught the image. It was one of those moments where I thought ""did that just happen?"" Birds have always been a divine sign for me that everything will be okay. As we brace for #hurricaneirma, the largest recorded hurricane to hit land, I'm holding onto that hope. Please keep everyone in the path of this deadly storm in your prayers. ??

beachyogagirl,"What is a real yogi? I've been criticized for not being one by people who claim they are. Funny... not very ""yogic"" to criticize others in general let alone their yoga. I've learned that no matter what, people will find error in what you do. It is important to keep your eyes focused on your own path or you'll end up in the ditch. Yoga is for everyone and you don't need to look, be or perform in any certain way. There is no ""right way"" to practice. There is only what is best for you.

VIDEO on LEFT: Notice the arch in my back? Also my legs, butt and feet are not engaged. It's much harder to hold a solid handstand when you are not aligned.

physicsfun,Chaotic Pendulum Kinetic Art: the motion of the skateboarder is that of a pendulum influenced by magnets in the skateboard and the mirrored base- chaotic motion (in the technical sense) is the result. When set into motion the resulting path taken by the figure will never be same as the last. Made in the 1970s by Otagiri. ??

physicsfun,Magni-Orb: kinetic art as oscillations about a magnetic equilibrium point. The base and sphere are carved from rosewood and have strong magnets embedded within them that produce an attraction. If the sphere is given some initial rotation it will exhibit complex orbits as the energy trades back and forth between potential energy and kinetic energy. The motion eventually damps out due to friction. A creation by Sven Petersen and imported by SAAP Denmark circa 1970. ??

physicsfun,Chain Fountain: as the chain flows out of the glass under the pull of gravity the beads don't simply roll over the edge but instead arc up upward like a fountain. As each link is pulled and tilted upward the adjacent link is tilted downward and pressed into the pile- by Newton's 3rd law the pile presses back pushing each bead upward into the air.

The ring system is color printed on transparency film- note that the inner ring edge to the outermost ring measures 73000 kilometers and could fit almost 7 Earths side by side. The rings around the actual planet are very thin though, about 1 kilometer thick, so the transparency film is 250 times too thick to be to scale, and even just the thin 0.010 mm ink layer on the film is 20 times thicker that the actual rings would be at this scale!

garancedore,"So, that french thing… Anytime I talk about being healthy (like these last days, trying to go without sugar) or exercise, at some point someone always tells me to stop becoming so American and stay a little bit French, relax and have a glass of wine.
.
It’s interesting, because I think it’s a misconception that all that French women do is to “relax and have a glass of wine”. They’re actually as concerned with their health as any other women, and sometimes as obsessive. A few cultural factors help, like regular meals and cooking at home are more of a thing, food quality is slightly different, but overall, we talk about our abs and our tights too. There is actually a real and exciting health movement in France as well!.
.

So don’t worry, I’m still very French but I also really like my newer American influences. And trying to be a little more healthy doesn’t mean that I’m becoming a health nut. It’s all about finding balance and allowing ourselves to change and evolve, in America or in France, no? .

The water is warm and so blue, you can rent a board for 20 bucks and go paddle out on the most friendly waves I've ever been on. You can see little fish swimming below you and yes, there are five million people experiencing the same thing around you but the spirit is so great, it doesn't really matter. Even locals don't shy away too much from all the crazy tourists.

Hace 3 semanas fue el eclipse total de Sol en Leo y te mencione que esto se trata que de agosto 2017 a febrero 2018, vas a generarte una nueva entrada de dinero, ganar dinero de manera diferente, reconocer mucho mejor tus talentos, cambiar de trabajo o emprender. Si bien esto es un proceso de 6 meses, hay momentos claves y estamos en uno. El Sol está muy activo en tu zona de la comunicación mientras Venus en tu zona de dinero/salario está conversando con muchos planetas. Esta es la semana para asesorarte y para recibir la ayuda de una mujer que te hace ver claramente lo que tienes para ofrecer. Puede ser desde una agente que busca trabajos para ti o una amiga que te ayuda cómo puede. Todo vale y vale oro aunque ahora no lo entiendas completamente. Mientras esto sucede y es muy bueno, Saturno está presionando un poco: responsabilidades, asignaciones pendientes, deudas etc deben pagarse y cumplirse, pero en vez de verlo como algo que estorba las entrevistas o asesorías que estás teniendo, míralo como la presión necesaria para no dormirte en el intento de darle la vuelta a tu vida. Es el momento.

La semana pasada fue la Luna Llena en Piscis, signo de finales y anuncia (de la mano con el eclipse total de Sol que hubo hace 3 semanas) que un gran cambio está por darse en tu vida pero que tienes que soltar algo que te es importante antes de abrir la puerta de la evolución. A este momento debes saber que está quedando atrás y que situación ha llegado a un punto de no retorno; pero no lo veas como algo negativo. Tu zona de creación, creatividad, procreación y romance se está calentando para que te motives a apostar más por lo que viene que por lo que se queda atrás. Y esa es justamente la ""tarea"" de Venus esta semana: que en colaboración con alguien, ayudada por un especialista, o al conocer a alguien especial, te motives a crear un nuevo camino, nuevo proyecto o relación. Esto no se dará inmediatamente, pero se será antes del 20 de septiembre que te quede muy claro que es ""eso nuevo"" en lo que estarás enfocando tus energías. Eso sí, se requiere mucha disciplina. La nueva etapa, la nueva creación o relación es para tu crecimiento. Hay ciertas áreas de tu vida que poner en orden para que eso tenga lugar y también asumir nuevas responsabilidades que vienen adjuntas. No dudes que estás lista, lo que quiero es que estés dispuesta. Una mujer será clave en tu entendimiento de todo esto o en el desarrollo de tu proyecto. Si hay eventos sociales el fin de semana no dejes de ir, porque Venus estará alineada con Júpiter en Libra (tu zona de parejas) y las probabilidades de pasarla bien o que una mujer te presente a alguien clave para tu futuro, son muy altas. También: usa esta semana previa a la Luna Nueva en Virgo para empezar o al menos investigar sobre cambios que quieres hacer por tu salud o oara simplificar tu estilo de vida.

mia_astral,"#StarsToday
Hoy no hay aspectos ptolomeicos, lo que me da chance de ponerlos a Uds en contexto.
La semana pasada tuvimos la #LunaLlena en Piscis que fue el indicador de la limpieza que tiene que darse después del gran #eclipse que augura cambios radicales. La Luna Llena limpia para que esos cambios puedan darse y sean el foco de nuestra atención en vez de seguir dándola a viejos modelos, metas vencidas y la vieja programación.
Esta semana es la media entre esa Luna Llena de limpieza y la Luna Nueva en Virgo (será el 20 de septiembre) que inicia un ciclo linar (30 días) en los que estaremos enfocados en empezar a construir la nueva realidad que viviremos con los cambios planetarios que vienen en los próximos meses (Júpiter en Escorpio + Saturno en Capricornio + Urano en Tauro + Quirón en Aries) que requieren de nosotros otras habilidades, otra manera de pensar.
El cambio de era, la limpieza y el inicio de la nueva etapa se está dando demasiado rápido. Aunque el tiempo es relativo, feo que a nadie le está quedando duda que las cosas pueden cambiar de la noche a la mañana, y que tenemos que ponernos al día, actualizarnos, estar en la mejor forma posible ( no, no le refiero a tu cuerpo), flexibles, adaptables y dispuestos.
Lo que parecía imposible ayer, es muy posible hoy, pero quiero que entiendas que esto también es para bien, y que cosas por las que has estado trabajando hace mucho, ahora empezarán a moverse porque ti estás con más ganas de crear que de quedarte atrás.
Por eso: aprovecha esta semana en la que estás terminando de limpiar y aclarando otro nivel de claridad sobre los pasos que quieres dar.

Esta semana estás muy apasionada, quieres una conexión real con otro porque Venus está muy muy ocupada en tu zona de pasión, intimidad y entrega. PERO... la tensión entre el Sol y tu planeta Saturno pide que seas precavida y escojas bien con quien compartes tu energía. Si sabes que estás con quien te merece y te sientes bien con su relación, será una semana muy intensa y de compenetración para ambos.

La protagonista de la semana es #Venus, planeta del #deseo #relaciones #atracción #colaboración

#Venus esta en #Leo (deseo de resaltar nuestros talentos, de llamar la atención por las razones correctas, dese un lugar de integridad, autenticidad y dignidad) entrando en un #grantrino de fuego. Ella va a conectar con #Saturno en Sagitario, con el nodo norte de la evolución en Leo y con #Urano en Aries. Este trino que toca el nodo y el grado del #eclipse del 21 de agosto (reactivación) se trata de despertar el deseo de iniciar cambios que ahora sabemos que son inevitables. Con disciplina, buena actitud y atreviéndonos a reinventarnos, cosas maravillosas sucederán. Hay que tener 1) la fuerza de voluntad de dejar atrás el pasado y 2) de colaboraron dejarnos ayudar porque #Júpiter en Libra también participará.

???
Juno, asteroide del compromiso, está en #Capricornio, signo del éxito/estabilidad/vista pública, desde allí nos empuja al fortalecer el compromiso que tenemos con nosotros mismos y lograr nuestros deseos y objetivos para así poder entregar nuestra luz a los demás. Juno es el Asteroide del amor verdadero, del soulmate, de lo que buscas en una pareja con la que te gustaría compartir toda tu vida. En tu carta natal, Juno indica las características de esa persona que tienes inclinación a escoger y su conversación con otros planetas indica cómo será el recorrido para encontrarle. Juno también rige los asuntos importantes en una relacion: desde dar en igualdad, servir al otro, o la sensación de seguridad dentro de la misma. La idea de que uno de los 2 es superior o inferior también se observa con este asteroide. En general, todas las características que en tu mente ayudan a atraer a The One, están expresadas en Juno. Sobre todo en una carta natal femenina: así te armas para atraer a socios/colaboradores/amores serios. En este #Astrobásico te mostramos cómo trabaja la energía de este asteroide?.

mia_astral,"Imagen de actividad solar??solar flares ¿Qué es?

Un solar flare ocurre cuando la energía magnética que se ha armado en la atmósfera solar es liberada. Se emite radiación en todo el espectro electromagnético en forma de ondas radio hasta ondas largas (long wavelength), emisión óptica a rayos X y rayos gamma.

Las más fuertes llamaradas solares se registraron en 1859 (septiembre). Ahora se registran unas muy altas (6 de septiembre, mismo día de la Luna Llena en Piscis); pero son comunes. Es importante saber cuando ocurre una muy fuerte.

Estás llamaradas afectan la tierra pues producen partículas de alta energía y radiación que son dañinas para los organismos. Sin embargo, la tierra de protege con su propio campo electromagnético. ??Si te lo preguntas...si. Esto influye mucho en los cambios que estamos viviendo personal y colectivamente ahora.

extremenature,"Hurricane Harvey will go down in the record books as the costliest natural disaster (to date) in the US. The scale of the destruction and widespread flooding is simply unimaginable. The zone where we sheltered in Rockport, Texas received top winds measured between 140-145mph. I personally recorded a pressure of 940mb with a calibrated barometer while inside the calm eye for about 2 hours. This is the second time I was inside an eyewall and hit by a mesovortex. The first time was while documenting Hurricane Charley in Florida. We could hear the mesovortex in the distance coming then wham !! It hit the hotel and blew the entire backside of the hotel to pieces. It was a loud explosion and instantly we could feel the draft inside the building. While standing on the 3rd floor I could feel the building swaying back and forth during each extreme wind gust. Most of the roof was ripped off so rain water was pouring from the top floor all the way to ground floor through the walls.

riptrippers,"I feel obligated to post this. Back in 2005, I was living in New Orleans when this so called Hurricane named Katrina was headed directly for The Big Easy. I remember like it was yesterday, most people living in the city at the time did not take it very serious that a category 5 storm the size of Texas with 157 mph sustained winds was on its way. Long story short, I was fortunate enough to get the hell out of there in time before she made land fall. Katrina ended up smashing NOLA directly! The eye of the storm ran right up thru the Mississippi River killing 1800 people flooding/leveling everything in its path. The top picture was Katrina, the bottom picture is Irma, which is right now heading directly for the state of Florida. Irma is larger than Katrina was, and even stronger. If you live in South Florida, please do what you can to get you and your loved ones out of there. This Monster of a storm is no joke! Homes can always be rebuilt, but the loss of a life cannot.

In this case, I don’t think its hurting much. It just a view from a hill, and the community around it won’t be bothered much by a few photographers on their mountain. But I often think about how tourism is affecting the places I love… and the role my photos are having in that ignition of tourism. ? Why am I posting it now? Well, I have a plan… it’s coming together. It looks like I’ll be visiting a place quite near to China. One I’ve wanted to see for a long time, and for many intriguing reasons… I won’t say where it is yet. But I imagine there's landscapes that look like this mystery country I'm talking about.

TA DA: @carlpernicus Congratulate him! I can’t tell where he lives. Just messaged him! ???????And here’s a caption for the photo: The Lavafall from the Big Island of Hawaii. I first shot lava pouring into the ocean when I started photography in 2012. I didn't realize how lucky I was to have witnessed this amazing phenomenon -- shortly after seeing it, the lava stopped flowing into the ocean and did not come back until 2016. This was taken in August. I came back to this location 4 or 5 times over several days and each time it would change dramatically. On the bottom of this photo, you can see the glowing ledge I'm standing on. When I  returned to this spot 24 hours later, the lava was flowing directly under me and the ledge was just too hot to stand on. I couldn't even last for 2 or 3 seconds to get a shot off!

myspacetom,"Crazy!! ? One thing I like about a shot like this - besides the lava - is that it clearly a singular moment in time. ?The water, wave, lava, rocks, fumes will never look like this again; it didn’t even look like this just a few seconds after this photo. Each shot is unique, and it’s amazing to see the literal formation of our Earth. ? Makes ya think, now doesn’t it! ?Anyway, Love me some lava! ?I went into zen mode at 4am this morning and processed this lava shot from the Big Island, Hawaii. It was quite difficult, but fun to manage the light in this shot—adjusting, dodging and burning so its not too hot in any one area. Lava does not want to be photographed, I’ll tell ya! ?The dynamic range on a shot like this — from the very bright spots areas to the darkest shadows — is very extreme, and not something the camera can handle easily. It took a bit of wrangling to get it to look like this, but I’m really satisfied with the results. ? Half the fun of photography for me is turning on some music and sitting down with the computer to polish an image like this. Recently I’ve been talking with a friend who’s convinced me to put some of my photos in an art gallery, book and store… It’s just the beginning phases, and I haven’t done the work needed to prepare the photos, but I spent the time and attention on this image with that thought in mind. I’d like to see this one in print :) ??",2017-08-02T18:49:59.000Z,Wednesday,465000,660,0,False,https://www.instagram.com/p/BXTVTDLF0Nw/?taken-by=myspacetom,0,784,23677,evening

This time, for the Big Island - the island with the lava running into the water! ??Lava pouring into the ocean is one thing I think everyone should put on their bucket list!! I’m going to the Hawaii tomorrow morning (and will actually meet the winner of the first contest). After a day in Oahu, I’m headed to the Big Island on Friday. Hopefully I will return to Instagram with an amazing lava-entering-the-water shot!! (My fave!!) ?For now, hope you all enjoy this little peaceful river in Iceland, cause my next photo is gonna bring the fire!!

cassiedepecol,"Many people who try to do big bold things in the world find out it's not about the money or the technology: It's about the regulatory hurdles that will try and stop you. - Peter Diamandis
• • •
Did you know that over the course of the 3 years of the planning and execution of my Expedition, I approached between 5,000-10,000 potential investors and companies for sponsorship and ended my Expedition with roughly 22?
People who approach me about sponsorship have no idea as to how difficult of a path that is to go down if they're looking to pursue a humanitarian or travel goal. Not only is it a major risk for the sponsor to invest in you, but it's a massive job to even land just one, cash sponsor, which I don't think many people realize. Because I didn't graduate college, I wasn't able to obtain grants from non-profits or organizations, which held me back, so I had to figure out alternatives. Being a 25 year old blonde, American woman at the time, was a red flag for investors and potential sponsors to want to contribute since the risk level of something happening to me was high, which would result in a loss to them.
• • •
To get a goods, services or apparel sponsor is not difficult, since it not much of a loss on their end and many of these companies want to support projects that align with their CSR. But to get cash sponsors and investment, is much more challenging. For this, you need a pitch, deck, proposal, a whole lot of patience, networking, not taking ""no"" for an answer and tough skin. The amount of times I was told ""no"", was over 5,000. But those setbacks taught me what I needed to tweak in order to get 22 ""yes'"".
• • •
I would never encourage anyone to pursue investors or sponsors for cash for their project or goals, and instead first, apply for grants, donations from organizations, crowdfunding, etc.
• • •
No one can teach you how persistent you need to be to succeed, even me. You have to find the strength and determination within you. It's a will to win, a will to thrive, and a will to survive. It's not easy, it's mastering the art of ""hardball"" in the business world and sometimes you just have to learn through experience and failure. ?",2017-08-19T16:15:37.000Z,Saturday,464000,212,0,False,https://www.instagram.com/p/BX-1JVvAJeh/?taken-by=cassiedepecol,0,2783,3858,evening
cassiedepecol,"Fact: The most I went without sleep on my Expedition was somewhere between 68-72 hours (!). Don't think it's possible? It was easier than you'd think when I had to cram the following into a 24 hour day, nearly every single day for 18 months and 10 days; sending out my pitch, deck, proposal to sponsors and investors, following up with current sponsors, filling out visa applications, organizing the next meeting with the students and dignitaries, trying to get hotel sponsors in the next country, booking the next country, exploring the current country, managing social media, vlogging, collecting content; photos/videos for the documentary and book, journaling, answering interview questions for the media, working out/staying fit, updating my websites, skype calls, etc. etc., all in one day. ????? People viewing my Expedition from the outside looking in thinking that I was on ""vacation"", meant that I was doing my job properly. Of course the last thing I wanted was to show you was the reality of the trip; posting photos and videos of me breaking down at border control at 2am in some third world country where they wouldn't let me in because of my appearance; out of money, no wifi, not knowing the language and completely emotionally and physically depleted and sleep deprived. No one wants to see the hard times, which for me, was 80% on that trip.
But back to sleep... ?. It took 5 months AFTER my Expedition to where I could finally sleep through the night. The stress based insomnia from always needing to watch my back or wake up for a flight made sleeping a challenge in and of itself. If you haven't heard of the app called CALM, I was asked to share a calming story from my Expedition, and I chose to write and narrate one of my favorite stories from Antarctica in hopes that it'll help people who suffer from anxiety or insomnia like I did, and calm them to sleep. It's a beautiful story, one of my personal favorites from the trip, and I'm really grateful to the team at CALM who reached out to me to not only write but narrate my story for you all to hear. ?

To listen to my story, you can head to the link in bio which will take you to the CALM app. Hope you enjoy! ?",2017-08-19T02:14:28.000Z,Saturday,464000,212,0,False,https://www.instagram.com/p/BX9U4mDg7ND/?taken-by=cassiedepecol,0,2783,1172,night

moonmountainman,As the seasons change I am reminded how beautiful and refreshing change is. For me my 2 big moments of change this year was quitting my job as a nurse to pursue photography full time and becoming a dad. As difficult as both of these changes have been it is precisely the kind of life I want to live. Chasing dreams and living life outside of my comfort zone.,2017-09-11T18:00:31.000Z,Monday,441000,275,0,False,https://www.instagram.com/p/BY6PbxSDZwI/?taken-by=moonmountainman,0,551,8338,evening
moonmountainman,"Following the Kautz Glacier Ice Chutes (previous post) we had only 2000 vertical feet to go to the summit of Mount Rainier but those last few thousand feet were not a give me. This late in the season (September) we were faced with crevasse after crevasse. Only a few were small enough to jump over, most of them forced us into making long traverses across the glaciers to find a way around them and 2 of them were impassable except for weakening snow bridges that hadn't melted out yet (pictured). Once we navigated through, around and over the many crevasses we finally reached the summit of Mount Rainier at 14,410 ft. Standing up there amongst the steam vents coming from deep within the volcano, we looked out above a ocean of forest fire smoke. We couldn't see anything else except the Mountain and ourselves. It was just us alone with the mountain.
Special Thanks once again to @alpinethatcher for being my climbing partner and for helping me get this rare shot of myself. Thanks buddy ?

moonmountainman,"After having hiked up Mount Rainier 7,200 ft the prior day, we (my partner @alpinethatcher and I) woke up at 2:00 am, ate breakfast, put on our gear, and started climbing towards the summit. After only a few hundred vertical feet above camp we reached the Kautz Glacier ice chutes (11,250 ft) that from below reminded me of the ice wall in Game of Thrones. Armed with ice tools in each hand and crampons (spikes) on our boots we began climbing the 45-50 degree steep ice. As we climbed, the leader placed ice screws directly into the exposed glacial ice and clipped the rope that connected us together to it in order to protect us from potentially falling to our deaths. Once we reached the top of the ice chutes (pictured) we continued up the mountain finding our way around, over and through open and hidden glacial crevasses on our way to the summit.... to be continued.
If you have any questions, please ask them and thank you for your continued support.

moonmountainman,"On Tuesday and Wednesday I had to joy of climbing and successfully summiting one of the most beautiful and challenging mountains in the the lower 48 States, Mount Rainier (14,411 ft). I've visited the mountain many time before and always find it difficult to comprehend its size. Even on Tuesday, when I reached Van Trump Park (2200 ft above where we started at Comet Falls) It was hard to believe that we still had nearly 5,000 ft vertical feet to climb to reach camp and another 3,600 vertical ft to climb to the summit via the Kautz Glacier Route. (route and elevations are marked in the attached photo). This particular climb ended up being one of the most difficult and challenging climbs I've ever done due to the elevation gain and technical nature of the massive glaciers this late in the season. Over the next few post I'll be sharing more from this climb as part of the #MammutChallenge use this tag to join the challenge and get entered to win some sweet gear

Before Zoey came into this world, We vowed that she would never be an excuse to not continue living our lives to their fullest and chasing dreams.

My shoulders have had to get stronger, I've had to allow Zoey to set our pace and she sometimes dictates when I am able to do things such as photography (my work) but the pay off of her smiles and growing in the outdoors is worth every extra effort. #liveyourownadventure #ebcontributor @eddiebauer

Also as a world of thanks to everyone that does their part, during our nearly 4 week long trip through Montana and Wyoming, I only found and picked up a hand full of garbage left behind by others. That is awesome. Far to often I feel like we, myself included, like to complain about the garbage we find in our wild places but after hiking well over a 100 miles and spending nearly every day outside, only finding a handful of garbage is fantastic in my opinion.

moonmountainman,"Waking up early, before the rest of the group, I took the canoe out on to the completely still Missouri River and started paddling up river just as Lewis and Clark had done on May 31, 1805 while exploring the west in present day Montana. That day they reached the White Cliff (pictured). In his journal Captian Lewis wrote: ""The hills and river Clifts which we passed today exhibit a most romantic appearance. The bluffs of the river rise to the hight of from 2 to 300 feet and in most places nearly perpendicular; they are formed of remarkable white sandstone which is sufficiently soft to give way readily to the impression of water.""
After paddling up river for a good 20 minutes I had a deep respect for what they did and turned around to let the river take me back to camp. This is my last #montanamoment with @visitmontana I hope you enjoyed to moments and seeing a place that is rarely shared here on IG.",2017-08-31T13:31:14.000Z,Thursday,441000,275,1,False,https://www.instagram.com/p/BYdb30fjVsv/?taken-by=moonmountainman,1,551,9414,midday
moonmountainman,"As the Lewis and Clark Expedtion made their way up the Missouri River with the mission, amongst many, to find an all water route to the Pacific Ocean in 1805, Lewis or Clark would walk on land while the expedition worked their way up the Missouri River taking notes/specimens of new species and mapping the river. As they pasted through the prairies of Montana (this area) Louise described seeing deer, antelope, bison, elk and bear without number covering the prairies in every direction. What a beautiful site it must have been! While I sat here above one of the camps that they used along the Missouri River, I couldn't help thinking that one of them sat in this very same spot looking out on this American Serengeti scene.

scott_kranz,"Breathing in air with only half the oxygen as at sea level, we took our last few steps up to Kilimanjaro's crater rim as the morning sun peaked above the eastern horizon. Making it to sunrise was a goal in itself, the local Tanzanian climbers told us. It signaled the end of several bitterly cold hours of climbing by headlamp and that we were so close to our objective. Just the boost I needed to tackle the last leg to the summit, not to mention a sight I'll never forget!

Following several days of trekking and acclimatization, we made it here, Barafu High Camp at about 15,000 feet. Just hours after this sunset, we woke in the middle of the night and started our summit push. As we trekked up, we witnessed the entire sunrise unfold. Each step forward became an effort in itself, but I eventually set foot on the summit in some of the thinnest air I've ever reached, only half the oxygen as sea level. A challenging but life-changing experience.

It's morning here in Tanzania, and today we kick off our Kilimanjaro climb with @anywhere.

scott_kranz,"Some places exhibit beauty regardless of time or season. I've solo snow camped at this remote spot in the dead of winter when everything is buried in tens of feet of snow. I've reached it in the peak fall season when the golden larch look like flames along the granite landscape. I've now experienced it in the lush summer months as part of a single-push thru-hike through the wilderness area. We sat along its waters and rested, sharing snacks to lighten our packs and staring up at the surrounding towers of granite. I knew we couldn't stay long, but the familiar scene reminded me of these past adventures and stirred up thoughts of how special places such as this both change and remain the same, ever enticing another visit with new eyes.

Shortly after, everyone was called to the gymnasium for an early dismissal. It was chaotic. We were told an airplane crashed into the WTC. It was difficult to understand what that meant until I came home and turned on the TV. I remember hearing people's stories and crying. I also remember the imminent fear, ""what's going to happen next,"" I asked myself, but was too scared to ask aloud. Above all, I remember how our city came together.

bejamin,"Out of this glistening cave wall, flowed a full river, 30 feet in width. Not far later it whirlpooled, completely disappearing beneath a churning moraine of rock and ice rubble.
.
It took us a while to reach this spot, carefully picking our way. Is that surface solid or crumbling and cavernous? At one point I threw a fifty pound boulder onto a slurry of what looked to be passable ice. The rock cashed through and out of view. Nope... not that way.
.
Glaciers, like some wild animal, have a sense of hidden power. In a flash, beauty becomes tenacity. A shimmering surface hides grinding depths of the unknowable. Certainly that's part of the attraction. Stepping into their living world comes with a slight intake of breath, a holding close of ones own fragility, a part of your lungs that won't exhale until back on solid ground. An acute lesson of preservation... self or otherwise; tread with respect; lightly, and wisely.
.
Thankfully it was later, away from the glacier, that our only mishap occurred. @chelseakauai bruised her foot while jumping in a stream to shower off. Giving her a piggyback ride to the car, I was grateful she naturally leaves such a light footprint, and that the Mtn exacted such a light toll for our passage.",2017-08-26T19:59:59.000Z,Saturday,276000,274,0,False,https://www.instagram.com/p/BYRQYwZn2bu/?taken-by=bejamin,1,285,17285,night

rabisaha26,"Street Performers always intrigued me, the talent they have never gets noticed by the actual talent hunters and they have to work hard for pennies.
Welcome to the world we live where many genuine artists are overlooked. Time to give importance to art and the artist.
Artists of any kind deserve respect, the talent has to be respected. Up hauling a genuine talent gives the world another asset which the people need to see and learn from. There are numerous instances of actors, musicians being recognized on the streets who became famous. "" There is creator in everyone of us ""

Beyond this they almost always made countless sacrifices as they cared for and nurtured us through our infancy and childhood, provided us with the necessities of life, and nursed us through physical illnesses and the emotional stresses of growing up.""

kathrynbudig,"‘Feel all the feels.’ A quick, digestible and somewhat trendy statement. It’s also just the beginning of being in touch with your feelings, what they mean, where they come from, and how they affect you and others around you. The massive second step is actually talking about your feelings. Hashing it out. Doing the work. Saying the things percolating inside of you out loud. This is where I’ve always seen real shifts happen -- both in myself and others. My simple challenge for anyone reading this is to go beyond the feelings, beyond the writing, and actually talk -- to a friend, a family member, a life coach, or a therapist (or all of the above) -- whoever, but say it out loud. Cast the spell and reap the magic.

????????
*joy* Baby Budig! My mentor Maty! Wow, that feels like a lifetime ago. I dedicated five days a week in that room. Look at the determination on my face!
????????
*judgement* Look how tiny I was! Well, I guess that's what happens when you're 23 and doing yoga for two hours a day.
????????
*sadness* I was SO STRONG then. Injury free. My body and mind felt so light then.
????????
*resilience* Don't go there, Kathryn. Twelve years was a lifetime ago. You might be struggling with injury but you still have a body that serves you well. Keep positive, kid. ????????

-goes to the gym (which I hate, btw, but seems to be one of the few activities that doesn't make my injury flare it's nasty, vengeful head) and lies down on her myofacial ball-
????????
Bam. The flood gates open. The ball digs straight into a trigger spot and I can't tell if I'm crying from pain or emotional exhaustion. All I want is freedom in my body -- to practice like I once did in the Mysore room; to roll in Jiu Jitsu without fearing my own arm; to box without wondering how many pain patches I'll need after. To make peace with my aging and ever-changing body -- the body that could once float around in handstands but now holds me down.
????????
A victorious roar would normally be inserted here, but I don't have a pretty takeaway or conclusion. Just that this physical journey is hard. And we're all going through it. Not letting it ruin my day, or allowing myself to believe the past was better. Rather giving my emotions permission to live.

wycked_shaun,"Sometimes I wish we have a rewind button to start over but then we're would all the fun be in that.. yes it's nice be able to say we're perfect and never make mistakes. Honestly though yes we all have fu*ked up st one point or another. No one can claim ""perfectness"" always. So what we all must do as we go through life is simply take the lessons learned when we fail, fu*k up, fall down or simply don't get where we want to.
.
Know that sometimes it's God's way of saying this particular situation, person or thing isn't meant to be in your life and sometimes it's not in definitely rather than at that particular time and place. You never know how things will turn out because none of us can predict the future, the only thing we can predict in this world is who we are, how we act, & how we handle to each individual situation! Once you understand this and the true intentions behind your own actions on a daily basis just know that whatever comes from it will be gods intended plan for you! So just pursue it as you can fail but if you do it's simply going to be a lesson learned and for you to continue to grow as an individual no end of the world.. pick up yourself up, dust off the bumps and brushes and continue moving forward. #camelbackmountain #bringmeback #missyou #nevergiveup #aesthetics",2017-09-11T01:32:16.000Z,Monday,212000,2464,5,True,https://www.instagram.com/p/BY4eVjZHwKg/?taken-by=wycked_shaun,0,2025,13138,night

cbquality,"I see so much about self care these days and tho I think most of it is amazing, when our mental health comes up it's a push for meditation (which IS helpful!,) etc. However, a major part of my self care is therapy, which is rarely talked about. I'm not sure what the shame is surrounding therapy but everyone could actually benefit from it. Caring about your mental health or wanting to examine your life does not make you weak or soft or incompetent. Mostly we are functions of what we were conditioned to feel / think / do and aren't always conscious of why we are how we are. We might have conflicting thoughts about ourselves or repressed feelings we have just accepted rather than believing it can change. Seeking out perspective from a qualified person or group might just be the best thing we can do for ourselves as humans and for those around us everyday. ?

evakosmasflores,"Elderberries from @botanicallyinspired's garden ? She gave me some when I came over the other day and I'm planning on making an elderberry cordial with them when I get back home! For now they're in the freezer staying put (plus it will make the berries easier to de-stem that way).
.
Also, thanks so much for your support and messages about the wild fires outside of the city. I really appreciate it ?? There are so many people who are struggling right now and don't have anywhere to go, and so many firefighters that are fighting the good fight trying to keep it from spreading. As of right now, it's burned about 33,000 acres, is 7% contained, and is the largest wildfire in the United States. PNW Outdoor Women has a fundraiser going to help the volunteer firefighter associations in Oregon, and you can donate here: www.gofundme.com/PNWOWgivesbackOR You can also donate to the Red Cross, who're helping provide temporary shelter for evacuees. Hoping for rain so that this all ends soon....

evakosmasflores,"Just got back home last night to ash raining down from the sky and heavy smoke filling our neighborhood. A couple of teenage boys set off fireworks on a hiking trail along the Columbia river gorge two days ago, and now over 10,000 acres in this incredibly beautiful national scenic area have been destroyed and the fire is still going. The gorge is my favorite place in the world, and it's where we hoped to buy land and start a sustainable biodynamic farm someday. We've hiked the trail where the fire started, and imagining the beautiful forest surrounding Punchbowl Falls burnt to a crisp crushes my soul. But, I know that nature is also very resilient and that once they are able to get the fire out the land will, over the years, recover. In the meantime, I'm putting out a general plea to PLEASE stop lighting fireworks, ever, period. They are a HUGE fire hazard, *especially* in the summertime, and a few seconds of entertainment are not worth the loss of someone's home, land, and life. Please PLEASE *please* throw your fireworks away (especially if you have children in your home that could get into them when unsupervised). Ok, that's the end of my rant and now I'll go back to posting food pictures.... ?

evakosmasflores,"If you notice the little dark red swirl in the sliced part of the cake, that's a delicious raspberry compote that I swirled into the batter before baking it ? In my opinion, nothing makes a cake tastier than shoving as many berries as possible into it and then baking it until they're all gooey and juicy and melt into the cake-y bits. There's just something about the burst of rich berry hidden inside of a bite of yellow cake that's the best kind of surprise ??

evakosmasflores,"The apples on our apple trees are getting bigger and starting to develop a blush, which means fall is slowly creeping closer and closer. Part of me is sad that the summer is coming to an end, but the other part (the bit that’s sick of sweating and all the wildfire smoke and getting up an extra hour early to water all the plants) is prettttttty stoked for autumn. Autumn means apples, pumpkins, pecans, winter squash, knitting, pears, baking, roaring fires, and gathering with friends. Basically, all of my favorite things. I think I’ve stoked myself up a notch just writing about it now ?

What about you? Are you more of an autumn or a summer person? What’s your favorite part of each????

Fear, paranoia, anger... these kinds of emotions are fine to have, but humanity needs those with red buttons to refrain from the weakest points of the human condition, not magnify them. Let’s embrace creation, companionship, and ignore our differences to make a better world than what we were presented when we entered it. Regardless of what god or collective consciousness you subscribe to, go be a good human today. Do something for someone else.

Naturally, a regular debate amongst us is our automotive bucket list. We don't agree on much except we can pretty much all concede that a driving tour across Italy in some of the country's most iconic GTs would be on it.  So, over the course of the week, we’re going to pick five of the ones we’d like to do it in. Naturally, we will begin our “road trip” in Modena, birthplace of this Maserati Ghibli. Recognized as one of the most successful Italian achievements of the sixties (some of you may want to argue this point) it was a direct competitor of the prestigious Ferrari Daytona. And like many Daytona’s, this particular Ghibli is has been converted to the beautiful and rare Spyder configuration. Under the hood lies a 330hp engine paired with an all-important 5-speed manual transmission. We feel that combined with it’s all leather-lined two seat interior gives us not only the perfect combination of open air comfort and performance but, also makes @stevechasesclassics have to sit this part of the journey out (he knows why). However, here’s where we need your help. What are some of the best driving roads and any local pizzerias on the way to our second destination of Maranello where we are sure you can guess the car, but can you guess the model? ?

The 456 is the forgotten Ferrari with its understated and somewhat modest appearance. But being the accountant that I am modesty is a virtue and for that reason alone the 456 is one of my all time favorites Ferraris. Big naturally aspirated V-12 up front? Check. Gated 6-speed transmission? Check. Cool enough to brag about owning one on social media? Absolutely. And with four seats you could even share some pictures of you and your friends in it. To further my argument this particular example can be had under $100k. So, before you purchase a new 991 in paint to sample Acid Green or put some terrible wrap on it, take the modest approach and grab yourself something classy instead of flashy ?

From time to time, the auction world gives us insight into concept vehicles that may have been more or less forgotten. While some Chasers may remember the Conciso, a quick recap for those who don’t. Constructed in 1993 using a 1989 Ferrari 328 GTS as the basis, the Conciso (or Concise) is the work of the Bernd Michalak Design Studio of Mainz. Michalak’s goal was to combine function and enthusiasm is automotive form resulting in a no frills, open top lightweight alloy bodied, two-seater Grand Prix car. Passengers of the Conciso did away with nearly all luxury touches including doors, A/C or a radio. While the standard Ferrari 3.2-litre, 270 bhp, V8 engine and five-speed transmission were retained, an extensive diet resulted in a 30% weight reduction which helped cut the 0-60 down to around 5s and took it all the way to a top speed of around 170 mph. Having lived a concept’s life, the Conciso remains only about 6k miles from new. So was this Ferrari’s missed field of dreams moment or an ugly duckling best left in the vault? ?

@stevechasesclassics isn’t quite sure we are there yet with this car but @jordanchasesclassic and @keithchasesclassics are convinced otherwise. Thus why once again we need your help settling this. And we chose this example from @legendcarcompany as exhibit A for the argument. Originally billed as the replacement to the 911, it’s pretty clear that it never lived up to that expectation. However, loads of cars, from lots of brands have suffered (and still are) that fate and are extremely desirable now. So that’s a moot point. This fully loaded, well optioned 928 GTS would have easily eclipsed $100k when new, making it one of the most expensive cars on the road at the time. Yes, there are some imperfections on the interior (Keith still thinks it’s better than the Renault 5 Turbo 1) but, it’s a 25-year-old car that despite the low mileage was driven. It also has just underwent a major service where the timing belt & water pump were replaced. So, who’s side are you on? The right one with Keith & Jordan or Steve who couldn’t drive it anyway because he can’t drive a manual? ?

.
Picture: Jewelle Gomez (b. September 11, 1948), San Francisco, California, 1984. Photo by Sean Reynolds, c/o @lesbianherstoryarchives.
.
Jewelle Gomez, who turns sixty-nine today, is an American author, poet, playwright, critic, and activist, best-known for her 1991 novel, “The Gilda Stories,” and her frequent contributions to publications including @villagevoice, @ms_magazine, and the Journal of Lesbian Studies.
.
In the early 1970s, Gomez moved to New York City, worked in Black theater (she previously was on the original staff of WGBH’s “Say Brother” (now “Basic Black”), one of the first weekly Black television programs) and got involved with the lesbian feminist movement. In the mid-1980s, she was a member of the founding board of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (now @glaad).
.
In 1991, Gomez published “The Gilda Stories,” a retelling of the classic vampire myth with a lesbian feminist perspective; “Gilda” is the most popular of Gomez’s seven books. Her poetry can be found in countless anthologies.
.
Gomez and her spouse, Dr. Diane Sabin, had been engaged for years when, in 2004, they were asked to serve as plaintiffs in the case that led California’s Supreme Court to hold that marriage equality is a constitutional guarantee.
.
In November 2016, Gomez wrote an open letter to the lesbian community: “I know the ascendency of an autocrat to the presidency feels like an insurmountable setback, but we’re dykes…So it’s time we look back to the lesbian culture that nurtured and radicalized us to raise our consciousness again. We’ll find the strength in numbers as we used to do and reinforce circles of friendship that can be effective on a local level by strategically supporting progressive projects, institutions and political campaigns. Those circles also support us personally rather than just virtually. A hand on my arm when I feel myself sinking into post-election despondency is worth so much more than a hashtag or link to an article. Lesbians are the link, to each other and to the future.” #HavePrideInHistory #Resist #JewelleGomez",2017-09-11T15:23:06.000Z,Monday,148000,183,3,False,https://www.instagram.com/p/BY59a1MDXpM/?taken-by=lgbt_history,4,3261,1837,midday

.
On September 11, 2001, as chaos unfolded around him, Father Mychal F. Judge, chaplain of the Fire Department of New York, removed his helmet and knelt beside a mortally wounded firefighter to administer last rites. As he prayed, debris crashed down from one of the nearby Twin Towers, striking and killing him; Judge, 63, who friends described as “not out and not closeted,” was the first person to be officially declared a victim at ground zero.
.
Mark Bingham, 31, had a history of standing up to bullies and would-be muggers, so friends and family are absolutely sure that he was one of the United Airlines Flight 93 passengers who overpowered the plane’s hijackers, causing them to crash in a field outside Pittsburgh.
.
Carol Flyzik, 40, and her partner of 13 years, Nancy, had just finished a long weekend together; Carol woke up early on September 11, told Nancy she loved her, drove to Boston, and boarded her flight to Los Angeles. Her plane, American Airlines Flight 11, was the first of the two planes to crash into the World Trade Center.
.
David Charlebois, 39, helped carry the banner for the National Gay Pilots Association at the Millennium March on Washington in 2000; marching in uniform had been one of the proudest moments of his life. Charlebois wore his uniform on September 11, when he copiloted American Airlines Flight 77, which later crashed into the Pentagon.
.
Ronald Gamboa, 39, Dan Brandhorst, 42, and their 3-year-old-son, David, were returning to Los Angeles from their annual trip to Provincetown when their plane, United Airlines Flight 175, was hijacked and crashed into the south tower of the World Trade Center.
.
There were other LGBTQs who died on September 11, 2001, and many more who played a heroic role in the aftermath. If not for the incredible work of @theadvocatemag, however, the stories of those from the queer community may never have been specifically told. #lgbthistory #HavePrideInHistory #Resist",2017-09-11T13:19:06.000Z,Monday,148000,183,3,False,https://www.instagram.com/p/BY5vOiujY8j/?taken-by=lgbt_history,2,3261,4221,midday

lgbt_history,"“There is no beauty without strangeness.” – Karl Lagerfeld
.
Picture: Karl Lagerfeld (b. September 10, 1933), c. 1975. Photo © Corbis.
.
Karl Lagerfeld, who turns eighty-four today, is an iconic German fashion designer, artist, and photographer, best-known for his decades of work at the head of, among other fashion houses, @chanelofficial, @fendi, and @karllagerfeld.
.
From an early age, Lagerfeld expressed an interest in design and fashion; as a child, he pored over fashion magazines and was known to be sharply critical of what classmates wore to school. As a teen, he earned the attention of French designer Pierre Balmain, for whom he worked for three years.
.
While his early work generally was not well received, Lagerfeld found success when he began designing for Tiziani in 1963; from there, he started to freelance for such fashion houses as Chloe (where his spring 1973 collection was praised for its ""high fashion and high camp""), Curiel, and Fendi.
.
By the 1980s, Lagerfeld had established himself as one of the world's great fashion designers, and his work with Chanel and his own label further cemented his stardom.
.
Lagerfeld's career, however, has not been free from controversy; among other things, he has a history of making disparaging comments about women with what he deems to be less than ""ideal"" forms (including, recently, @adele) and he is unapologetic about using and wearing fur.
.
In the early 1970s, Lagerfeld started a long-term relationship with socialite Jacques de Bascher that lasted until de Bascher's death from AIDS-related illness in 1989 (he was thirty-seven); for many years, Lagerfeld could not speak of de Bascher without bursting into tears. #lgbthistory #HavePrideInHistory",2017-09-10T15:45:05.000Z,Sunday,148000,183,2,False,https://www.instagram.com/p/BY3bI7cDjso/?taken-by=lgbt_history,4,3261,1820,midday

lgbt_history,"“Ladies and ladies! Gentlemen and gentlemen! We are the Lesbian Avengers! Here to demand and ensure visibility and survival of lesbians everywhere!” – Jenny Romaine, September 9, 1992
.

.
In the early 1990s, a group of New York City educators wrote a curriculum “to teach first graders to respect the city’s myriad racial and ethnic groups.” The result, called “Children of the Rainbow,” was 443 pages of diverse lessons and activities—“from Irish ballads to the Mexican hat dance, the recipe for Greek New Year’s Day bread to the Japanese version of rock, scissors, paper”—that also included three references to gay and lesbian families, as well as recommendations for three gay-friendly children’s books.
.
The gay-friendly content infuriated parents and administrators, none more so than the president of District 24’s school board, Mary Cummins, who called the curriculum “dangerously misleading propaganda” and accused supporters of selling “as big a lie as any concocted by Hitler or Stalin.”
.
Weeks before the 1992 school year, in the midst of the curriculum battle, a new direct action group formed in New York City; focusing on issues of importance to lesbians, the group—calling itself The Lesbian Avengers—planned an inaugural demonstration.
.
On September 9, 1992, twenty-five years ago today, 60 Avengers descended on P.S. 87, a Queens elementary school in Mary Cummins’ district. With a fully-lesbian marching band (“Oh when the dykes, oh when the dykes, oh when the dykes come marching in”), enormous signage (“Teach About Lesbian Lives”), and hundreds of balloons encouraging kids to “Ask About Lesbian Lives,” the Avengers introduced themselves to the world.
.
“That simple action,” one Avenger wrote, “encouraging students to ‘Ask About Lesbian Lives,’ still ranks as one of the most radical LGBT efforts ever to fight erasure, confront bullying, and take on homophobic taboos.”
.
While the inclusive curriculum soon was sidelined, the Avengers were just getting started. Within months, the fire-eating group became a worldwide lesbian movement. #HavePrideInHistory #Resist",2017-09-09T16:06:04.000Z,Saturday,148000,183,2,False,https://www.instagram.com/p/BY04vzEjO63/?taken-by=lgbt_history,0,3261,4760,evening
lgbt_history,"“STOP VIOLENCE AGAINST GAYS AND WOMEN” – “THE POLICE AREN’T ON YOUR SIDE EITHER” – “GET YOUR FILTHY LAWS OFF MY BODY,” march against violence and injustice, Dublin, Ireland, March 19, 1983. Photo by Derek Speirs, c/o “Out for Ourselves,” Irish Queer Archives. [TW]
.
On the night of September 9, 1982, thirty-five years ago today, Declan Flynn sat down next to a young man on a bench in Dublin’s popular cruising area, Fairview Park, four other men rushed out from behind surrounding trees. Flynn ran toward the park’s gate, but was unable to escape the gang; the five attackers—Tony Maher (19), Robert Armstrong (18), Patrick Kavanaugh (18), Colm Donovan (17), and an unidentified fourteen-year-old boy—beat Flynn so badly that he died within an hour after reaching a hospital. He was in his early thirties.
.
Flynn, who had done some volunteering at the local gay center, was one of many gay men attacked in Fairview in the summer of 1982, as a series of bashings went largely unnoticed by police.
.
“We were,” Robert Armstrong later said, “all part of the team to get rid of queers in Fairview Park.”
.
On March 10, 1983, the five attackers—each of whom admitted to playing a role in Flynn’s death and attacks on other gay men—walked free with suspended sentences. “This,” the presiding judge explained, “could never be regarded as murder…One thing that has come to my mind is that there is no element of correction that is required. All of [them] come from good homes and experienced care and affection.”
.
On March 19, the Dublin Gay Collective organized a march to protest street violence against gays, lesbians, and women, and to draw attention to the unjust sentences consistently handed down by courts in cases against attackers. In what is considered Dublin’s first Pride March, approximately four hundred people marched from Liberty Hall to Fairview Park. #lgbthistory #HavePrideInHistory #DeclanFlynn #Resist",2017-09-09T13:55:04.000Z,Saturday,148000,183,4,False,https://www.instagram.com/p/BY0pwURjVos/?taken-by=lgbt_history,0,3261,4153,midday

jaredwhitney,"People are so much more valuable than places or things. But it's also true that places help develop who we are. Today some of the most beautiful, iconic, and serine places from my life went up in flames as the #EagleCreekFire consumed large swaths of the Columbia River Gorge just outside of my hometown of Portland. To locals - especially those of us who have lived here all of our lives - it felt like a death. While it will eventually return to being lush and green and scenic, unfortunately it may take longer than some of us will be around for.
This is so much more than photos. This is about the places that make Oregon special. Unique. Beautiful. It can all be gone so quickly.

If you're ever venturing out to hike, camp, or otherwise, remember that you are a guest and that it can all be gone so very fast.
Much love to those affected and those fighting to keep the fire at bay from homes and people.",2017-09-06T04:13:37.000Z,Wednesday,127000,631,1,False,https://www.instagram.com/p/BYr407VFCCQ/?taken-by=jaredwhitney,0,1296,1091,night

yanyahgotitmade,"Have you seen a #8MonthsPregnant woman squat 225lbs (102kg) before? Probably not.
.
The reason why I say this is because of all the controversial discussions my videos have caused. Not to mention all the negative, rude and disrespectful comments and DMs I have received because of this.
Some person compared me to a meth addict, others have said that my obvious goal is to get a miscarriage while most of them have all called me an idiot. And it's all fine.
I am not bitter, I am not angry or sad about it because I know that it's due to their lack of knowledge, insecurities and failures.
I know that what I am capable of is not of the average human and anything that is different is often strangely looked upon.
I am just here to share my experience and knowledge in a field I believe I have mastered. Not through books and theories but by practice and involvement.
I have listened to my body, been in tune with myself and my growing baby since the day I found out about her. I have grown AS a human while she has grown INTO a human and together we have pushed through every workout.
Thankfully with the support, love and care from @thefitguy_ who has been there to monitor my every move in the gym for the past months ??????
We are now in the final stage of pregnancy and my workouts are slowly becoming more modified to my growing body and the Symphysis pubis dysfunction (SPD) that I am dealing with.
This has resulted in to me wearing a pelvic support belt and to keep my squats less deep. Whether I can stay at this weight or not is something my body will let me know but for now this might be the last 225lb squat video for some time.

yanyahgotitmade,"#32WeeksPregnant #8MonthsPregnant and I still have some core definition, even though I am over 210lbs (95kg)
Some people might wonder how it's possible and honestly I even ask myself that same question some times.
The truth is that the answer is very simple; it's due to a active, healthy lifestyle in combination with the right diet!
The results are guaranteed if there is a commitment and dedication towards what you want, you just have to believe in yourself and the strength you carry inside you as a woman.
We sometimes don't give ourself credit to how powerful we really are. We limit ourself to what society have decided for us, what it thinks is enough.
Putting boundaries and restrictions on possibilities, dreams, goals and even on new knowledge.
I'm not here to sugar coat the hardships, nor to find excuses and the easy way out.. but to show you all what we are capable of, to inform and teach you that pregnancy is not a disability and shouldn't hold you back in anything you find important or love.
.
That's why the new project I am working on is so significant to me! It will give me a new platform to share my knowledge and experience with you all, specially all moms and expecting mothers out there. I can't wait to share it with you guys once it's all done.

#8MonthsPregnant #31WeeksPregnant and still squatting 225lbs for reps.
.
I am getting more and more tired as I am getting closer to the due date. I honestly don't have energy for much but I still make sure to stay active and to push to my best ability while at the gym.
Staying fit and healthy is a priority for me specially now during my pregnancy.
I've got many negative comments because of this, some people claiming that I am selfish, careless and vain for doing what I am doing.
However days like today are exactly why I let these people bark and don't allow them to change my mind or actions for a second.
I received the gestational diabetes test results at the Dr appointment we had yesterday and my Dr delivered us the news very excitedly. Telling us that I passed it with absolute flying colors!
Two hours after drinking the glucose solution, a normal blood glucose level is lower than 155 mg/dL (8.6 mmol/L) and to pass it a woman should score 135. I however, scored a level of 113!! Which is exceptionally great and even though I have had my fair share of ""cheat meals"" this have not affected me at all, this is all due the results from being constantly active during my pregnancy.

yanyahgotitmade,"Entering the 8th month of pregnancy tomorrow.
Not much left and I can without a doubt say that this last trimester isn't easy; it's not as awful as the first but far from as good as the end of the second either.
The pregnancy symptoms are many, some are more uncomfortable than others while a few symptoms are bearable.
.
My top 3 worst symptoms I have had to deal with have been:
1. Symphysis pubis dysfunction (SPD)
2. All day morning sickness for the first 4months.
3. Exhaustion
.
Thankfully I have @thefitguy_ by my side for everything I need help with, from being my personal driver, assistant, bodyguard, plumber, bag carrier, personal shopper, assassin, gym partner and trainer. He has made this experience of pregnancy much easier and I am both blessed and thankful for having this beautiful soul in my life! I don't know how some women do it all by them self, my ultimate respect goes out to you!

.
?2014.
The year I immigrated to the US for a second time, not in a literal sense but for sure in a figurative way after escaping 5 years of extreme domestic abuse.
I was feeling lost, lonely, hurt and broken.
Alone in a foreign land with no documents or legal rights with all my loved ones across on the other side of the world.
After years of living in some of the harshest neighborhoods of New York City (Bushwick Brooklyn, Queens Bridge Projects for 2 years and Corona Queens for another 4) I had learned how to survive by always keeping my guard up and never really being able to feel relaxed, protected or safe - specially because the most horrible perpetrator was the man I was sharing my bed with.
However, the day this picture was taken was the last day I allowed myself to be a victim anymore. It was the last day I walked down a self destructive road and the day I slowly learned how to love myself.
.
?2016.
This picture was taken two years into my fitness journey.
Two years in of constant hard work, of sacrifice, dedication, commitment and perseverance.
Two years of being sober.
Two years of growing, obviously physically but much more importantly emotionally and spiritually.
Two years of loving myself and accepting my present but also my past.
Two years of learning how to forgive those who have hurt me but not to forget.
And two weeks after winning my first NPC Figure competition I ever attended and one day before winning my second one while also brining home the overall title.
Those victories was a symbol to me of so much more than just the bodybuilding trophies I brought home during those two weeks.
.
?2017.
Loved. Loving. Happy. Appreciated. Protected. Unlonely. Hopeful. Confident. Fortunate. Healthy. Grateful. Affectionate. Brave. Optimistic.

yanyahgotitmade,"????PREGNANCY AND EXERCISE MYTHS DEBUNKED????
.
NOW LET'S SET THINGS STRAIGHT ???????
.
A lifting ""weight limit"" for pregnant women is like saying that one-size-fits-all maternity clothes would be a thing. They aren't.
We can all lift different weight prior to pregnancy and in pregnancy, so it's almost comical to see how many people that are misinformed.
Think about it, women been having babies while working on farms, carrying water to villages, cutting wood to lifting animals and other children all day, for centuries! Our bodies are meant to function.
Just look at the rest of the animals in the animal kingdom; the lioness for an example, actively lead a hunt just the same way she did before she got pregnant and only withdraw from the pack once she realize she has to give birth.
The even more comical thing about it all is that the people who have the most negative things to say is 95% men. As if they know for a second how it is to be a woman or really know how the female body functions, specially during pregnancy. (Let me not get started on how little some of you really understand the female body ?)
I believe all those rude, uneducated and misinformed comments come from a place of insecurity and self flagellation. A place of hurt egos and battles with ""little dick syndrome"" when seeing a woman in her most vulnerable state still outperform them.

yanyahgotitmade,"I don't have a problem squatting 225lbs or deadlifting 245lbs for reps while pregnant.
It doesn't hurt, it isn't uncomfortable and quite honestly it is not as challenging for me as many people would believe it is.
My form is modified to my pregnancy to make sure I'm putting safety first to prevent injury or any other misfortunes situation.
This doesn't mean that my pregnancy have been easy or that I have been blessed from many of the symptoms, because it's been far from that.
I've just sucked it up, pushed through and refused to give up or complain.
I have left workouts in the middle of a session to throw up, wash my face, recollect and return back to finish my workout in my first 20weeks.
I have pushed myself even while exhausted to show up to the gym even though I would have loved more than anything to just lay in bed and not do anything at all.
This is because I know it will benefit me and our baby in so many ways but mainly physically with strength and more energy but also emotionally while dealing with all the stress and hormones that pregnancy comes with.
Besides all that, I also unfortunately deal with Symphysis pubis dysfunction (SPD) it is a condition that causes excessive movement of the pubic symphysis, either anterior or lateral, as well as associated pain, because of a misalignment of the pelvis. This is a extremely painful condition that is diagnosed in approximately 1 in 300 pregnancies.
It has cost me to drop certain workouts, like walking lunges, kickbacks or any movement that is similar to that - even walking is something that I can't do for long anymore and hurts much more than any stationary movement I do while in the gym.
However that too will pass once the baby is here, so there is no point to feel sorry for myself or to limit myself more than I have to! There is ALWAYS ways to work around pain, injuries or uncomfortability when you really want to.
Excuses are for losers, while obstacles are just challenges for those who are winners!
.
Ladies, who else is dealing with SPD? Please comment below ?

curvyelle,"Birthdays have always been surrounded by weight obsession, and since mine is approaching on Wednesday I've started to feel the anxiety creep up. In the past, I'd normally embark on some kind of a crash diet in the weeks prior to the day, and then I would celebrate my ""newfound beauty and thinness"" with a massive birthday binge. [?Ugh] .
.

Thankfully, I'm not doing that this year, and while it feels freeing to let go, it also feels a little... scary, especially as I sense that my body is thicker, fuller, and bigger right now. It's been tough to quell the negative thoughts and not look at old photos from last year when I was noticeably smaller and judge myself. So tonight I'll be lulling myself to sleep with the most loving, kindest affirmations I can muster: You are worthy. You are radiant and talented. And how lucky it is that you get to celebrate one more year, surrounded by good health, a beautiful, strong body, and more love than a person could ask for. ?

""It’s my own sort of escapism,"" he has said. ""Everything inspires my work: lived experiences, cultural and social phenomena. But it is more and more about that internal gaze, a mix of these utopian and dystopian ideals."" regram: @julesdebalincourt

Here's a picture from his exhibition ""Irons for the Ages, Flowers for the Day""  at the SCAD Museum of Art, last summer. “Irons for the Ages, Flowers for the Day” examined the conflicts and damages of war and weapons. Hongbo recreates crude tools of war from brightly colored, honeycombed, laminated paper and reshapes them into delicate abstract forms resembling floral patterns. By removing all signs of destruction and chaos, the artist transforms the sinister intent of the weapon into a venerable landscape of flowers, evoking feelings of sublime optimism.

The immersive mixed media installation is a social commentary on the roles of the American and Chinese educational system and their part in distorting history and propaganda to impart on young, impressionable minds.

We walk in our sleep and teach our muscles to work without thinking, and I dare you to walk where you have not yet walked. I dare you to notice sights that you have never seen before. Don’t try to get anything out of it, because you won’t. Don’t try to make use of it, because you can’t. And that’s the point. Just walk, see, sit down if you like. Feel the moment. Just feel who you are with whatever you have and realize that is enough for being happy.

sawwaki,"Sometimes it is hard to show your inner world or feelings; sometimes it feels like words are not needed. There are also times when there is so much to say but no courage to do so. Fears of prejudice, rejection or misunderstanding can easily take over. No one can understand or feel exactly the same as you or your loved one - we are all unique in our own ways, do not try to change yourself in hopes to become accepted or loved. Instead try to share and open up so you could emotionally get to the same energy level. Only then you can reach to healing, understanding and bonding. In case of rejection or anger of your other half, there is no need to answer the same way. It is important to be patient until he or she is ready to open up. Sometimes it takes weeks, sometimes it may take months... But when you see the true colours of your loved one, you know it was worth the wait!

There were just four of us in the plane, the pilot, my hiking buddies, and myself. He dropped us off not far from here and then flew away, not to be seen again for 8 days. It was just us, a map, compass, and a satellite phone. No trails, no people, nothing but glacier after glacier until oblivion.

jenamays,"In honor of Princess Diana of Wales. ??The Queen of People’s Heart??.
Diana was a fashion ICON, but more importantly she took every opportunity to bring awareness to different issues around the world. In 1987 (without protection from gloves) she shook hands with a man who was suffering from HIV. With her kind heart and loving hands single handedly changed many people's perspective that this illness could be passed from person to person by touch.
.
She knew the people suffering from this condition needed compassion and understanding, not fear and ignorance. I idolize her courage and strength to stand up for what she truly believed in.",2017-09-01T02:00:21.000Z,Friday,102000,465,0,False,https://www.instagram.com/p/BYexmlgna8X/?taken-by=jenamays,0,1016,1179,night

organicandhappy,"Friends, I don't post a whole lot anymore, but when I do, I want it to have meaning. Today, I really want to introduce you to someone special. This is Julia. She's had a dream: to open a yoga studio that is for everyone, because yoga IS for everyone. Every person, every body, and every paycheck. And she did. @ourplaceyoga is a yoga studio opening THIS SATURDAY in Orange County, CA, where classes are only $5. I'm so excited to start attending these classes - I've been looking for a studio for a long while to feel comfortable in, and have always had trouble feeling included. I've always struggled with yoga as something from my Indian heritage that has now been turned into something that it never was - a form of fitness for perfect girls with big wallets. That's not what yoga is; it's meant to help you achieve meditation, mold your spirituality, and to connect with your inner self. I'm excited for $5 classes, but I'm mostly excited for the heart and warmth of Julia, and can't wait to see her studio blossom into the pillar of health and happiness that Orange County needs and deserves. Come out this Saturday for a yoga class at 9 am, 12 pm, or 3 pm, and enjoy @meadsgreendoorcafe 1-3! I'll be at the 12 pm class.

There will also be a nightly transformation on the exterior of the building, with sounding alarms and spooky lighting. #disney #disneygram #disneyland #disneyfan #instadisney #disneyparks #halloween",2017-08-25T14:30:41.000Z,Friday,95500,398,7,False,https://www.instagram.com/p/BYOF59cBNB0/?taken-by=disney_health,2,122,1938,midday

With that being said.. the family has gots lots to do to prepare for Irma.. beginning tomorrow and throughout the next few days. You may not see as much of us as you are used to and we may not be able to answer questions.. For those who have asked: We will be staying with family during the storm, probably beginning on Saturday, but mom may have to stay at her job starting tomorrow evening. We just don't know right now what the next few days may bring. If mom gets stuck having to stay at work tomorrow, We most likely will not be able to post updates until after the storm passes, utilities are restored and we are allowed to return to our homes. We will post if we can. We do live in a mandatory evacuation zone, but only because we are in a flood zone living on the river. It is still very soon to tell exactly where the path of Irma will take her. But at this time it is pretty certain we will feel very strong effects from the storm even if we are not hit directly. We are still praying she will continue to move further east away from our shoreline.. we will see.
Our thoughts and prayers are with all our friends and family in the path of this horrible storm. Be safe, my friends!

thebeerwench,"Today is World Suicide Prevention Day. Being both a survivor of multiple suicide attempts as well as someone who has lost a few friends to suicide—today is extraordinarily important and extremely emotional for me.
.
It's surprisingly hard for me, even though I'm a very self-expressed writer, to find the right words and the right message for this post. I want to share my story—my personal struggle and experience with suicide. I want to portray my survival as a message of hope and inspiration—but, I also don't want to glamorize suicide in any way shape or form.
.
I have been struggling with suicide ideation since my early twenties. Thoughts of taking my own life have consumed me for nearly 14 years. In order to cope with feelings of failure, a sincere fear of intimacy and my overall lack of self-esteem and self-worth, I found myself drawn to self-destructive behaviors. Anorexia was first, albeit fleeting. Then came the self-mutilation and alcohol abuse.
.
My brain chemistry also changed dramatically in my 20's. Excessive hypomania as a child ultimately evolved into a bipolar 2 diagnosis when I was 28. Sadly, this diagnosis did not come easy or early. It took a truly traumatic and gruesome act of self-harm before I would get diagnosed.
.
In the summer of 2012, I grabbed my JA Henckel's chef knife, sharpened it good, and then took it to my own arm. It's impossible to explain what goes on in the suicidal mind in the moment of the act. My mind was void of all logic and reason. I was possessed by the obsession. There were no thoughts of consequences or regret. There were no thoughts at all—just obsession.
.
I came back to reality when I looked down and saw my own blood gushing out from my arm. Everything became blurry from there. I remember the blood, the sirens, the police, getting rushed to the hospital in an ambulance—but no faces, no words.
.
After 5 hours in the ER, I found myself back in an ambulance—this time restrained and enroute to a psychiatric hospital. Sadly, it would take 5 years and 2 more attempts before I got the help I needed. But, I did get help. And now, I'm dedicated to helping others survive. My story isn't over yet. #iamasurvivor",2017-09-10T23:57:15.000Z,Sunday,74800,1093,1,False,https://www.instagram.com/p/BY4TdnXDGm-/?taken-by=thebeerwench,0,1997,1031,night

Oh yeah...

No
No. It floats!

A few posts ago, I threw a bone to my friends over at @flattummytea for sending me a lovely care package (the tea even arrived in a cute little carrier case). This is my third go around with this regimen (activate in the morning, cleanse at night) and I've gotta admit that it does the trick. No, it's not a miraculous weight loss potion, but it does help with water retention and bloat. And trust me, I'm a total carbaholic and I've got a super crazy ""salt tooth""—this girl holds water in her body like a camel.

thebeerwench,"Today is uniquely bittersweet and surprisingly sentimental for me. Six years ago today, my friend Ryan and I started the first #IPAday—a global beer-themed holiday created to celebrate one of craft beer’s most iconic styles: the India pale ale.
.
Founded in 2011, IPA Day is a global celebration of craft beer. It is a universal movement that was created to unite the voices of craft beer enthusiasts, bloggers and brewers worldwide. IPA Day was originally developed as a social media-based holiday, but has since expanded into a worldwide party, boasting hundreds of IPA-themed events and celebrations all over the globe.
.
A lot of time and effort went into planning, announcing and launching IPA Day. We worked closely with the Brewers Association, dozens of breweries and beer writers, bloggers and influencers across the world to make this day the success story that it is and continues to become.
.
When I made the excruciating decision to leave my career in the #craftbeer industry behind—my greatest, most narcissistic, fear was that all of my hard work, my advocacy, my passion and love would be forgotten. I was terrified that I would be forgotten. And that no one would like me or want me once the beer aspect of my persona and reputation was gone. I sincerely thought that beer justified my purpose on this planet and that, without it, I was essentially nothing.
.
This morning, I woke up to hundreds of IPA Day posts of twitter, Facebook and Instagram—and dozens of articles discussing it all over the web. I felt melancholy, relief and joy all at once. I may not have left the legacy that I always wished to leave behind, but my work did not die with me—errr, you know what I mean.
.
I just want to take a moment to sincerely thank all of my craft beer friends and fans for picking up where I left off. Thank you for continuing to carry my torch, I am forever indebted to you. Miss you like crazy, love you forever—Ashley",2017-08-04T00:15:03.000Z,Friday,74800,1093,2,False,https://www.instagram.com/p/BXWfSy7j0wX/?taken-by=thebeerwench,0,1997,1831,night

.
I haven't lost any muscle ""strength"" per se, but I have gotten a little soft—especially, around the tummy area. The hardest spot to get results, and the first to lose them.
.
And sooooo, I hit up my friends over at @flattummytea (again) and they were kind enough to send me another sample package of the Activate & Cleanse teas. Super stoked to startup this regimen again. Going to experiment with making them iced as well.

.
It's no secret that I have a love affair that borders on obsession with chicken wings. They embody everything I love in food—crispy fried goodness, juicy meatiness, spicy, salty, savage-like required eating techniques. And they pair perfectly with one of my most favorite list things in the whole world—no, not beer (but I used to love to wash them down with IPAs)—college football.
.
I've probably eaten between 2-5k wings in my lifetime. And I'd venture to guess that a couple hundred of those were the savage wings from Russian River Brewing Company (picture above). I'm quite certain that they put crack in the savage sauce. Its just... amazing. I think I would trade my right arm, okay maybe my left arm, for a shipment of savage sauce. (I need my right arm to eat with, my left arm is kind of a pos. Pretty useless, imo.)

thebeerwench,"THROWBACK THURSDAY — to one of my favorite photos from one of my all-time favorite beer festivals, the Lagunitas Beer Circus (circa 2013?). People ask me all the time, if and what I miss most about my past life in the beer industry.
.
A lot of people assume that I miss the liquid the most. It's a fair assessment, considering my complete transparency and honesty regarding my unhealthy relationship with and dependency upon alcohol. But, it is important to note that those things were the reasons that I stopped drinking alcohol—and not the driving force behind why I fell in love with #craftbeer and, ultimately became an expert on the subject. I sincerely loved the liquid—and the craft and the passion that went into making it. I was truly the geeks of all geeks. I respected the product just as much, if not more, than I abused it. But, alcohol is a nasty drug, my friends—and it is particularly nasty to those of us who suffer from extreme emotional disorders, such as bipolar disorder in my case.
.
I'd be lying if I said that I didn't miss the flavor of beer—but I sure as hell don't miss the drug component of it. Depressants are deadly for me. As of this Monday, my system has been clean and sober for 7 months. I have completely lost any and all cravings and desires to consume alcohol of any type—including my former love, beer.
.
What I really miss the most about craft beer is the people and the community—my people and my community. I miss my friends, I miss my former employers and all my coworkers, I miss my customers, I miss interacting with my friends and followers on social media, I miss the festivals and events—I miss the world of beer, but I don't miss the liquid.
.
Leaving my career in craft beer was, by far, the hardest decision that I've ever had to make in the short 34 years that I've been alive. But, it was also the smartest, healthiest and most important decision that I've ever made for myself. And I'm so grateful for all of the people that have stuck by my side, despite and especially because of my decision. If you are still reading this and still following me, chances are I was just talking about you. So thank you. This kiss is for you!

andrearoberson.ai,"@kaydevasart I told you about the EDGE program when you were like 15...so if you forgot... Enhancing Diversity in Graduate Education

EDGE: “If you look at the numbers of African-American women Ph.D.s in math, they’re teeny-tiny,” says Radunskaya. (In 2010, there were a total of 10 Black women who earned mathematics Ph.D.s.). “In the past seven years or so, EDGE has contributed 25 to 40 percent of those African-American women,” she adds

LINK: IN Bio and Below

https://www.edgeforwomen.org/

From: EDGE Program Helps Women Complete Graduate Math Programs

Women have made major advancements in post-secondary education the past few years, yet there are disciplines where they are still severely underrepresented. According to the National Center for Education, in 2010, although women represented about 52 percent of all Ph.D.s, they earned fewer than 30 percent of math and statistics Ph.D.s.

Average drop-out rates for all graduate students are between 40 and 50 percent, and women are even more likely to drop out than men.

To address these discouraging issues, Sylvia Bozeman of Spelman College and Rhonda Hughes of Bryn Mawr College teamed up in 1998 to launch the Enhancing Diversity in Graduate Education program, which aims to help women flourish in and complete their graduate math programs.

Despite the challenges of getting women through their graduate programs and into high-profile careers in mathematics, and despite the historical underrepresentation and cultural barriers, EDGE shines when it comes to helping minority women succeed.

Though women have made advancements in mathematics, there’s still a long way to go. In the future, Radunskaya hopes to have several programs around the country to make sure that they reach as many women as possible.

Technical Interview Prep Topic:

Probability

Practice Question:
How would you explain Conditional Probability to an Engineer?

@kaydevasart I found a fun source to answer this question.  If we are going with the Ross Book.  We can also go with Ross himself.  Bob not Sheldon.

Checkout: A Statistical Analysis of the Work of Bob Ross

LINK: In Bio and Below

https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-statistical-analysis-of-the-work-of-bob-ross/

From: fivethirtyeight

1.? Bob Ross was a consummate teacher. He guided fans along as he painted “happy trees,” “almighty mountains” and “fluffy clouds” over the course of his 11-year television career on his PBS show, “The Joy of Painting.” In total, Ross painted 381 works on the show, relying on a distinct set of elements, scenes and themes, and thereby providing thousands of data points.

2.?I decided to use that data to teach something myself: the important statistical concepts of conditional probability and clustering, as well as a lesson on the limitations of data.

3.?We can find the probability that Ross painted something given that he painted something else, a statistic that’s called conditional probability.

4.? Conditional probability can be a bit tricky. We know that 44 percent of Ross’s paintings contain clouds, 9 percent contain the beach and 7 percent contain both the clouds and the beach.

We can use this information to figure out two things: the probability that Ross painted a cloud given that he painted a beach, and the probability that he painted a beach given that he painted a cloud.

1. ?Start Preparing Now

2. ?Screening questions are commonly phrased like this: How would you explain to an engineer how to interpret a p-value?

3. ?I think people tend to believe the myth that all anyone cares about is what you’ve got up on GitHub, big companies, don’t look at your GitHub, they look at your résumé and cover letter.  I did a ton of interviews at Nordstrom and I can tell you that I was very critical of résumés and letters

4. ?Get an intro probability book.  If you have Ross, I recommend doing the self-tests in chapters 1 – 5 and using those tests to help you decide where to spend more time.  Combinatorics and basic probability questions are the norm for phone screens.

5. ?I also used Casella and Berger, basically the Bible for statisticians, to review the properties of expectations and variance.

6. ?Coursera is literally the shit.  You can easily get by with the material on Cousera.  I hiiiiighly recommend the Biostatistics bootcamps from Johns Hopkins.  They are an excellent review of the first year of grad level statistics

7. ?For CS I primarily used Programming Interviews Exposed, Cracking the Coding Interview and Programming Pearls.  Exposed is def the most comprehensive of the books and if you only have time to look over one, go with that one.

You ask, I answer. Today I'm exhausted and my brain is seg faulting, so I will write this angry. Caption recommended for: anyone who doesn't have the patience of a toddler. The new fish tattoo is hugely inspired by Fahrelnissa Zeid, whose retrospective exhibition I had the pleasure to see here in London. Zeid, one of the first women to attend art school in Istanbul, was described as a salmon swimming upstream in her industry (the male dominated art world). That resonated with me. Yes, this has nothing to do with the reproductive cycle of salmon, but if you have ever seen a video of salmon fighting a torrential water current all while avoiding the giant bears waiting to wipe them out at the top, you will get where I am coming from. They are following their encoded urges even if it is the most difficult journey they will ever make (and one that ultimately leads to their death). That is how I feel about my career in technology. I CANT and WONT do anything else, this is what I was encoded to do. Even though I've been trampled and bear clawed every step of the way by everything from just how fucking difficult software engineering is (I'm writing this from a C++ BLACK HOLE DEPRESSION), to fundamentally being a woman (which I won't even go into and is beyond the scope of this caption). This tattoo in particular feels like my war paint or a call to arms. It makes me feel powerful. It makes me feel like I might just even understand C++ templates in the next 10 years (optimism).

I wish you the best school year. The BEST #JuniorYearEver #HU19

Enjoy your first day of school!!!!! Follow your heart.

I hope I have not inadvertently pressured you into Math in anyway.

I only wanted to give you the Choice. But I am very scared of you going down this path.

Cons:
1.? Maryam Mirzakhani. First woman to win the Field medal. Died July 14th

2. ?Your cousin died in Grad School

3. ?Janel is suing her job. After years of assault on her humanity.

4. ?Susan Fowler’s year at Uber…Etc.

My sister Devin was a big fan of having a theme. I try to follow her lessons.

My IG account has had two major themes. Now a third. With a new name.

1. ?The thread that ties the initial images together…is DNA. And my #BRCA1 genetic mutation. I wanted to have a different outcome than my mother and sister. I wanted to survive to share their lessons.  There are photos of that time

2. ?My cousin was discouraged to pursue Mathematics as her college major. Mostly by people unaware of the access, career choices and opportunities the degree could provide. Unaware of what it has given me

So I showed her an exhaustive list of pathways.  On Instagram.  I also joined Howard University’s Math club. I wanted to stay informed and pass along the resources from our HBCU networks

#NeuralNetworks  #GetIt? #Sorry

3. ?Now it is already Junior year. She knows where she can work. (Anywhere). And I guess the entire world now knows....that At Least NASA hires Math majors #HiddenFigures

And thanks to that former Google Employee, the entire world now knows….ONLY 20% of Google’s technical employees are Women.

ONLY 1% of Google’s technical EMPLOYEES are Black

So like 2 Black women work there

But I don’t want my cousin to be discouraged.  There is a NEW opening. That guy who faked Actually having a PhD… did get fired

So my Third theme is the Technical Interview

@kaydevasart We are starting interview prep.  NOW

As Andrew Ng Says:

One picture to keep in mind is that, I think, setting up your dev set, plus, your single real number evaluation metric, that's like placing a target and telling your team where you think is the bull's eye you want to aim at

Because, what happens once you've established that dev set and the metric is that, the team can iterate very quickly, try different ideas, run experiments and very quickly evaluate classifiers and try to pick the best one

So, machine learning teams are often very good at shooting different arrows into targets and iterating to get closer and closer to hitting the bullseye

#FutureFounders

#EntrepreneurshipCamp

The @FutureFounders “Be Your Own Boss” Summer Entrepreneurship Camp teaches you all the skills you need to create and pitch your own business idea to investors.

Entrepreneurs are doers, so they have designed each day to be hands-on, different and fun.
Teens get a VIP pass to see every corner of Chicago’s startup community.

The camp is hosted out of 1871, the nation’s number one tech incubator space that has helped hundreds of companies grow.
.
This program will walk you step-by-step through the process of launching your own tech company.

The Schedule:

Last year, they had over 500 applications for 25 slots. They want to work with as many students as possible, so they have expanded the camp to serve more students.

In these small group sessions, you’ll work in teams to create a business idea over the course of a week-long intensive camp. At the end of the first week, you’ll have identified your business idea, built a basic working app prototype, and crafted your business pitch.

Teens from each of the week-long camps will participate in the final week of the camp at the same time from July 24 to July 28. At the Showcase, students will pitch their idea to a packed room full of guests in an expo-style format.

Tuition: Free

andrearoberson.ai,"@Twitter shares up 4% yesterday after billionaire investor Cuban buys shares as an #AI play

Mark's Comments:

1. ?People will lose their jobs unfortunately. There will be some disruption. But in terms of the market, particularly larger companies, you are going to see dramatically improved productivity. Hopefully, revenues go up, but the number of employees to support those revenues go down significantly. And I think that's going to increase earnings.

2. ?So companies that are geared towards Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning, Deep Learning, I've been buying.

My biggest holdings are Amazon, who I think is the leader in this space, Netflix for video, and I started buying Twitter just recently. Because I think they finally got their act together with artificial intelligence

From @CNBC

The remarks by Cuban came six days after Twitter reported better than expected first quarter earnings.

The social media company has used algorithms to combat user harassment, vowing to prevent abusive behavior and block repeat offenders from the site. They've also used machine learning to tailor ads and tweets to users.

Twitter said in its first-quarter earnings release, it continued to use other machine learning techniques to improve the relevance of notifications, which increased engagement and brought people back to Twitter.

3. ?Unrelated: @morrisonclarkhistoricinn I L O V E what you have done with the place

4. ?Related to the Hotel decor: I was supposed to mention that the CBCF #STEM Emerging Leaders: US-China Study Delegation is a study abroad program designed to provide African-American students living or attending school in Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) member districts with the opportunity to experience Chinese culture and learn Mandarin during a two-week visit to China. #FreeTripToChina

stephynow,"The yoga works. Let the yoga do the yoga. Be and let Be. This has been such a theme for me lately. And I'm leaning into the doing and this way of Being.
Day 10, for the #yogaeverydamnday challenge, I didn't post, nor did I do a physical practice yesterday. My body was wiped and needed rest. On Saturday night, I was out like a light at 8:30pm. #partyanimal
Today, day 11 for #yogagirlchallenge, I practiced Ashtanga at home. I prepared for my first Ashtanga-inspired class that took place today (new offerings at @solfirejstreet). Which I was nervously-excited and excitedly-nervous. My practice has and is changing a bit. And so has/is my teaching. And the beauty of this studentship is that yoga works.
Today, it was surprisingly nice (actually, really fucking nice) to not plan a music playlist or reach into the creativity belt of sequencing. Take the pressure off, if you will. Why do we do that, as teachers? Put the pressure on? Maybe it's just me, but I'm realizing how unnecessary it is. The yoga works. It's almost like I got take myself out of it and let the yoga do and Be with my students today. And I'm really grateful to everyone that showed up today to ride the breath with each other. Whether it's new or not, the practice is practice, and that's all there is to it. I'm virtually hugging these ladies for being the heart warriors in the room, @trynicki, @_amandavdub, and @rachelbreannestark. Thank you, thank you.

Day 9 of #yogaeverydamnday. I taught this morning, went to a pool party with my son's Judo club, and now I'm warming up to teach my 4:30pm class. I think we might be getting funky with it, ya dig?!
Last night, I sat in silence for a long time and did some writing. I posted snippets in my story. The final dose of my writing crept in a hint of: ""did I write too much?"" And I shared that very question. I've been writing my heart out in the open like this for years and I still gasp and question myself. Sometimes I'll feel what's real and write something so raw in the moment that I'll toss my phone down after sharing it. I'll walk away, not engage, and not come back to it for a time. It's like I have to settle myself. Or let it settle.

stephynow,"Friends, thank you, for sharing your words of wisdom and kindness after my flustered and frustrated mama-bear moment yesterday. One thing I know is that life entails tricky navigations of the heart(s) that beat outside our chests. We all are raising future leaders, whether you are a parent or not. Everyone makes an impact and leaves a mark on our children, therefore our future. Kindness matters. Compassion matters. Love matters. Thinking and believing and acting as so matters.
Today is day 8 of the #yogaeverydamnday challenge. I've not practiced yoga. I may or may not. I spent the morning reading The Mastery of Love and then off to a Love-packed breakfast with two special women in my life, @janna_yoga and @birthwisdomyoga_. It's so important to have women in your life that will nod to your real-life tough stuff, laugh with the what-the-hell stuff, and never let you feel like uh-oh-did-I-say-too-much stuff. These women inspire me to live, love, and let whatever needs to come up and out-out. I'm really digging this #yogagirlchallenge, I'm not one that participates in these online challenges but I am finding so much love and support from all of your shares. Saying what's real, even when it's scary. Being open and letting out.

And what started greatly has me feeling flustered a bit right now. I'm literally writing this post after having a long talk with my 6 year old about not playing with the mean kids at recess (some did some shit thing and I did my best to play calm, cool, and collected) and I ended the conversation with, ""don't play with kids that act like assholes."" And rambled off something about kindness. Not my finest parenting moment but damn this whole other people's parenting thing can really set me off my own hinges sometimes. And a big part of me knows we are all doing our best. Sometimes it leaves me questioning, ""is this our best, really?!"" And if not, what can I do. I feel like I'm in the shoulder lane screaming, ""I'm already pulled over!"" We can only meet people where they're at in their own lives. I'm taking deep breaths trying to chill the fuck out before teaching my back to back classes tonight.
This is life. Really-real.

I taught two classes back to back last night. Came home, showered, ate dinner, and passed out whilst sitting up on the couch while watching some stand up comedian. I feel like I'm at that age where I'm tired everyday, not as a complaint nor any comparison to the new mom's and dad's out there. Life is simply full.
Today is day 6 for the #yogagirlchallenge. I went for a walk this morning with @jessnapier and her handsome twin boys. I'm grateful for our coffee walk and talk, real talk. I came home and geeked out on some Ashtanga videos on YouTube, taking journaled notes and all. I've been watching Stu Girling and his approach, specifically, to chaturanga dandasana. Heels back and elbows back vs stacking the joints. This photo doesn't represent his teachings, it's just a photo from my archives. Today's practice doesn't look like a typical practice per se; more like watch, write, implement a few adjustments, take notes, feel that and this, get up, take a break, watch some more, write more, and break it down again. Sometimes I wish I had a yoga buddy for days like today to geek out on this stuff.

Day 4 of #yogaeverydamnday. Today, my practice was 25min of warming up before heading to teach class. Every year, on Labor Day, Sacramento celebrates free day of yoga where many yoga studios open their doors offering a variety of classes and teachings to students for free. I found myself feeling oh so lucky and grateful to teach to a packed house today. Everyone filled the studio with such loving and powerful energy. There's some kind of magic to moving and breathing together. It's intimate and sacred. I cannot put it into words. It's a feeling. It's inspiring. It's awe and wonder. It's too beautiful for words to screen.
Tonight, I'm feeling grateful. For those that continue to love their hearts out loud and live wildly present. Thankful to have @hiserra and @om_namaslay in that room this afternoon laying down their palms as an extension of their hearts.

Day 3 of #yogaeverydamnday with @yoga_girl was a day of togetherness. No physical practice, unless I can count hours of bowling, chomping down on pizza, and celebrating my nephew's 5th birthday surrounded with family. I shall count all of that because spending time with my family is a wonderfully wild and also quite the handful. Mostly, no one is on time, everyone talks at the same and from across the room, each dishing out some shit and talking big games, and running amok. I love their big and wild ways. With each passing year, I realize how close and yet how far we are from one another. It makes time in the now feel more like reflection of what was; perhaps that's what we do in the present, speak of a time, because we know the time we have today will be a memory or reflection of what was. Again and again. Time can be funny that way, a constant of now and gone.

My afternoon class is one of my fun-favorites because we get to play the music is a little louder and let loose a bit. It's got the whole work hard, play hard weekend vibe which is great-fun!
For me, a practice on Saturday is pretty rare. I like to take it easy, spend time between teaching classes by hydrating and eating some power foods. The outside temp today is set to hit 111 degrees so that means extra ease, hydration, and care to be taken.

sweyda,"I obviously have a tendency to be overly detailed.

While overly detailed illustrations pack a HUGE punch they are limited in application. The smaller the application the more degraded the art becomes when highly detailed. This ""less is more"" approach works at smaller application sizes (pins, patches, embroidery etc) ONWARD!",2017-08-30T14:15:30.000Z,Wednesday,99400,907,0,False,https://www.instagram.com/p/BYa8JOXnAhl/?taken-by=sweyda,0,3082,1760,midday

aninspirednest,"Today, I laid my mom to rest. A chapter in our story ended and a new one was born. This picture is of us shortly after our mother + daughter story began... (and what a story it was!). As I sat before my mom's casket draped in a gorgeous blanket of vibrant red roses, I thought to myself, I will never have this moment again. There are no second chances. No do overs. This is it.
I felt an overwhelming need to embrace the sadness spilling from my eyes onto my cheeks and be present. I found myself holding onto each word the chaplain spoke. I could hear birds chirpy in the curtain of trees that peacefully surrounded this moment. I observed a lonesome ant tirelessly climb in and out of a crack in the cement that zig zagged across the ground. I felt the squeeze of my youngest's hand nestled safely in mine.
I was there. In the sadness. In the happiness. In the fear. In the peace and in the calm. I was safely wrapped in years + years of memories. Comforting me. Reminding me. Reassuring me. Lifting me up and never letting me go.

aninspirednest,"I've never waded through the waters of losing a parent before. I've lost grandparents. I've lost friends. I've held the hands of friends who have lost parents. I've watched my parents lose their parents. I've felt the sharp edges of many different types of losses but none like this.
It's almost been two weeks since my mom followed the light into Heaven. Every day greets me with a new set of emotions. Some days I'm filled with a grateful heart for all the years I spent with her. Some days the thought of climbing out of bed seems too much to face.
In this short time I've learned so much about myself as well as the people I surround myself with. Hard times always reveal true friends. This ""hard time"" has shown me exactly who I can count on when my legs are too weak to hold me up.

Next week my family and I fly to Seattle to celebrate my mom's life. We've purposely kept the services very simple and uplifting. She would want it that way. She would want a room filled with happiness and smiles. A celebration where tears from the type of laughter that makes your tummy joyfully hurt outweighs the tears of sadness.
I've read through every single one of your heartfelt comments over the past few weeks. Thank you so much for sharing your prayers, your condolences, your stories, your heartache, and your words of light + encouragement. I can't even begin to tell you how many times I've sat down in front of my computer to respond to each one of your comments and found myself paralyzed with tears. I want desperately to respond to every comment, DM, and email... the truth is I'm not ready yet, friends. I know the time will come... I'm just not sure when that will be.
We all grieve differently in our own unique way... so I'll continue wading through these waters, reaching for the extended hands that suddenly appear when I can't stay afloat, floating to the surface and feeling the sun on my face, and smile upon the years + years of memories God blessed me with.
Much love to each one of you for blessing me day after day with your continued support. ??, Shannon

aninspirednest,"My heart swirls with relief, sadness, closure, and happiness as I write this. My mom is free of the pain and suffering that selfishly held her captive for seven long years. Alzheimer's finally released its grip and her beautiful life came to a peaceful end this weekend.
My mom is now in Heaven. I'm excited for her to be reunited with her parents, a brother she never got to know, family that left us long ago, and friends that were taken all too soon.
My mom loved to take pictures, travel the world, spread kindness, create beautiful things, smile a smile that melted hearts, and live a life of adventure to its fullest. She never went a day without telling her loved ones how special they were to her. She was so many people's sunshine in their darkest moments. She had a pure heart that was judgement free. She met everyone with open arms and listening ears. She was everything I aspire to be.
Thank you for all of the love, support, and prayers you've showered her and my family with over the past few days as she took her final steps on earth. They've comforted us like a warm, reassuring hug as we walked with her to the point we had to release her and let her continue on into the light.
The ""love"" tattoo on my wrist is my mom's handwriting. It's a constant reminder that I carry her love with me always.
Until we meet again, mom. I love you with all of my heart. ?? Your Shannon

aninspirednest,"When you judge another, you do not define them, you define yourself. - unknown
Who we choose to love. How we choose to live our lives. What we do with our time. Why we act the way we do. These choices set us apart from each other and tell our unique story.
No one has the right to judge another. No one. Instead of judging someone for a choice they have made, why not replace that judgement with empathy? Viewing someone through an empathetic frame allows us to understand their thoughts and feelings without passing judgement. Being empathic doesn't mean we have to agree with another's choices...it simply helps us to remove the harsh glasses of judgement and see their story a bit clearer. Being empathetic reminds us all that there is still love and kindness in a world that all too often condones criticizing others for the way they look, the way they live, the way they believe. Wishing y'all a blessed Sunday filled with love and kindness!

aninspirednest,"When I was 35, my mom was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. She was only 62 at that time. Now at the age of 69, her heart is strong but her body is deteriorating and is becoming too exhausted to continue on. Over the past few days, she's transitioned into a stage of Alzheimer's that we've never navigated before and the reality of losing a parent is becoming even more clear.

The cruelty of Alzheimer's has killed me over and over again for years since my mom + my best friend was diagnosed. During my last visit with her (this photo is of us together), I made the decision to no longer hand it that power over me. I am at peace with what lies ahead. I do not fear death. I am no longer wishing or pleading for a different outcome... I know there isn't one. I am free of worry, free of fear, and covered in strength. The road ahead seems less scary now that it's paved in the comfort of peace.
My calm comes from not wanting to see her suffer any longer as well as not wanting to drown myself in sadness or what ifs. She has lived a life of kindness, adventure, love, and with no regrets. A life to be proud of and one I model mine after. I am her image in so many wonderful ways.
May I please ask two requests from you? First, prayers for comfort from pain for my mom, that she is wrapped in peace and reassurance that her loved ones will be okay when she's ready to go. Second, tell your loved ones you love them. Hug a little tighter. Kiss a little longer. Smile a little bigger. Don't miss an opportunity to show someone kindness or how much they mean to you. Be present. Think about your priorities in life... who's important, what's important, & what can be forgiven + forgotten. Don't wait to do something you've always wanted to or say something you've been holding inside. Today may be all you have. Today may be all your loved one has. Don't waste a single moment on worry, fear, or regrets... it's not worth it. Surround yourself with people who build you up, inspire you, make you smile, are true, and make you excited to live everyday as an adventure. ? #endALZ",2017-07-17T20:57:14.000Z,Monday,67300,656,1,False,https://www.instagram.com/p/BWqXJGHl6BE/?taken-by=aninspirednest,0,967,1639,night

It was for a little over a day and we were on a mission to tackle some of the best eats from Paris's bakeries and cafés. After pastry-ing ourselves out, we did pizza and wine for dinner (judge us not!), saw the Eiffel Tower for the quickest photo opportunity ever, and I stocked up on an ungodly amount of skincare and a bit of chocolate. Paris is one of those places that everyone seems to fall in love with, and I couldn't understand why when I finally got there. I understood the shopping, but nothing more. I started a new job recently (hence my lack of posting) and it gave me the opportunity to return to Paris a couple weeks ago. I went with the intention to replenish my skincare collection, to be quite honest, but Paris's charm hit me right in the face when I walked through the streets with my coworkers. The thing with Paris is this: it has charm— you just have to pay attention... Its hole-in-the-wall restaurants, the old buildings, the generously kind servers, and the extremely passionate people are what made me understand why it's so revered. To some, it's the city of love; to me, it's the city that's rough around the edges and filled with charm. And really good pastries.

thedancingwind,"It's bison calf season in Yellowstone! Be sure to give the mamas and calves plenty of space. This means that you may need to take detours while hiking (I had to take 3 in a single hike) to stay at least 25 yards away from wildlife. Before taking our third detour, I looked through my binoculars and saw that a large herd of bison mamas and calves were clustered around the trail, with a ""nursery"" of 7 napping calves right on and next to the trail, so we planned our detour early. I also saw a solo hiker standing on the trail right in the middle of this scene, way too close to the bison, who were starting to surround her. Once safely on top of a steep wooded hilltop some distance away, @maxgorski and I started waving and calling to the trapped hiker to get out of there and join us, which she did. Remember that although bison may look docile, they can actually be quite aggressive and cause you serious injury, especially mamas protecting their newborn calves. #YellowstonePledge",2017-05-10T14:01:25.000Z,Wednesday,63500,328,1,False,https://www.instagram.com/p/BT6hgDJlSkF/?taken-by=thedancingwind,1,1015,1362,midday

Simply make a friend who doesn't look like you. Be intentional, and be authentic. Because it's only through relationships that real change can occur. And, sharing food together can be a key to speeding up that understanding. So let's come together, and let's eat together.

AND, they're now available in Indianapolis at @meijerstores! Our classic hummus is a great companion: just 5 ingredients and it comes together quickly. Pretty simple, if we do say so ourselves. ?

zachlipson,"Hey everyone. For the past 4 days I haven't really left the house. I've been heads down working on something important - a project called ""Prints For Houston"". Myself and 50 other photographers are selling prints to benefit the victims of hurricane Harvey. Everything is $50 on the site and we teamed up @honestframes to provide all the printing, so 100% of sales will go directly to the victims. The art up there is unbelievable, from some insanely talented photographers, many of which I'm sure you're already familiar with. This has been a lot of work and we have the potential to do something really positive here, so please do me a favor and check it out, link is in my bio. The people of Houston have a long way to go to rebuild their lives, this is our way of helping out. I have 3 prints up there as well, including the shot in this post. Thanks!

borderjunkie,"Let's talk ??WOMEN'S RIGHTS in Saudi Arabia ?? I've been getting lots of questions about this issue. So let me clear up some of the confusion as best I can.
?
Here is the current situation:
? Drive: N?
????School: YES ?
?????Work: YES ?
??Vote: YES ?
?????Sports: YES ?
?? Travel: YES ? (with permission)
?Dress: Women SHOULD be covered up when out in public. But from what I've seen (especially here in Jeddah) it's not something that's completely enforced. Many women go out in public WITHOUT wearing a hijab to cover their head or face.
?
There's no question my experience here in Saudi Arabia would be a very different one if I wasn't a man. So I guess I'm grateful for that, but to be very clear — I DO NOT in any way condone the diminished role of women in any society. Women should always be treated as equals no matter what. Without a woman NONE of us would be here! (Thanks Mom??) With that said, from what I've witnessed so far I'm very optimistic that things here will get progressively better, and better for women. Even the locals will tell you things are already much better than they were just a decade ago. ????? ??? ??
?
If you have anymore questions you can reach out to my friends @saraomar_travels and @nadaalnahdi — they obviously know much more than I do regarding the issue of women's rights here in Saudi Arabia ??",2017-08-29T10:36:29.000Z,Tuesday,61200,99,0,False,https://www.instagram.com/p/BYX-SNchFQT/?taken-by=borderjunkie,2,656,3976,morning

scotch_trooper,"“You may FIRE when ready.” - - - - - Being such a big fan of the Michter’s Toasted Barrel Finished Bourbon, I heard rumors of this new Toasted Barrel Finish Rye and was super excited. Especially when I learned it was bottled at Barrel Strength. This release was made by taking the Michter’s US*1 Single Barrel Straight Rye and finishing it in a custom toasted, but not charred, barrel. This extra step adds hints of dark toast and smoke, just the right amount of spice added to an already great dram. Another great release…. delicious. I would love to give it a side by side comparison to the Toasted Bourbon… if I could find a bottle. But in the same light, this is a limited release, so grab a bottle (or two) if you find one.

I mean, have you ever seen something and thought ""That was made just for me!""? Such was the case when I started seeing this decanter online. Then the messages started flowing in from my followers telling me about it. I had to have it. Then my buddies at @thefowndry stepped in and made it happen. I can't thank them enough. That said, I may or may not have an extra decanter laying around. Future giveaway maybe?

scotch_trooper,"“I have a bad feeling about this.” - - - - - When my buddies over at @whiskey_library_dc traveled to Islay (my home away from home) to select casks from Kilchoman for a Single Cask Release, I knew immediately that I had to get my hands on a bottle. When the bottle arrived, I surely wasn’t disappointed. This Single Cask Release is a 6yr ex-bourbon expression. The barrel itself is from Buffalo Trace and is guessed to have previously held Blanton’s. The young peat and sugary sweetness play perfectly on the palate, and at cask strength (59.2% ABV) it smooths out nicely and makes you wonder why you aren’t already taking another sip. This is truly a bourbon lovers peated scotch. That said, there are still bottles left, I would pick one up before they are gone.

One of the hardest parts for any whisky enthusiast is finishing a bottle. For me, the first 1/2 goes quickest, the next 1/4 I savor, then the last 1/4 is saved for special moments or visitors. But that moment always comes where you have to bite the bullet and finish it off. What's was your most recent and painful finished bottle?

Today may be #ForceFriday, but it's also the official release of the Macallan Edition No. 3. For this release Master Whisky Maker, Bob Dalgarno teamed up with Master Perfumer @rojadove selecting casks with distinctive aromas to focus on an incredible nose. Then they collaborated with @bompasandparr to create this glorious aroma diffuser to give yet another level of nosing enjoyment as you enjoy your dram. Or you could just use it to make your office smell delicious. Side note: no I have no idea how I got the mist to land in my Glencairn. I mean... yeah, I planned that.

Living in Jersey during the 90s, Clerks and Mallrats by @thatkevinsmith were played almost daily amongst my friends and I. So as I was scrolling through my old photos and came across this shot, one of my favorite scenes from Clerks popped into my head (Randal discussing the contractors that died on the second Death Star). So, of course I had to watch it. Again. For the 1,000th+ time.

The ever elusive Glenfiddich Snow Phoenix. When a warehouse roof collapses due to snow in 2010 Malt Master Brian Kinsman chose to use the effected casks to create this glorious limited edition whisky. This bottle will more than likely remain unopened for a bit. But we sure enjoyed a good amount of drams while at the distillery a few months ago. Truly one of my favorite Glenfiddich drams I've had the pleasure of having. Such a shame it's so hard to find. It's so sought after that I've seen bottles on auction sites ranging from $500 to $1,700. So yeah. If you see a bottle grab it. And give me a call.

Can you believe this is my first taste of Springbank? I know, right!? What took me so long? Well, better late than never, beause I sure do love this dram. Such a rich and creamy whisky. One that makes me want to just sit back with a guitar and play the night away. The sherry and light smoke play together perfectly and give you the perfect sweet dessert dram deserving of a killer soundtrack. Again, not sure why it's taken me this long to dive into the @springbankwhisky1828 range. But I'm sure happy I did.

Many thanks to @societyamanda and @thesmws for this writeup and interview.
.
Our whisky influencer interview series continues! Amanda Victoria (@societyamanda) sat down with the famed the @, Mr. Brett Ferencz, to go behind the scenes on what makes his IG following so unique. #theSMWS
.
AV: How'd your love of whisky begin?
.
BF: My whisky journey started only about 4 or 5 years ago. A buddy of mine and I were given tickets to see Rush perform in Nashville. He had been trying to get me to try whisky for a while, and since the seats were free, we splurged and ordered a dram (not that I knew what that was at the time). I was a fan on first sip. It sure didn’t hurt to have such an epic setting and soundtrack to my first whisky. Oh, It was Glenlivet 12yr.
.
AV: How did Scotch Trooper come to be?
.
BF: Scotch Trooper started quite soon after that concert. I knew I had a bunch to learn and wanted to find out from others before I bought my next few bottles. I knew there was a huge whisky community on Social Media but I wanted a screen name that showed I was interested in whisky, but also wasn’t taking myself seriously since I had no idea what I was talking about. I have been a freelance photographer for years, so I started by just posting creative bottle shots (there weren’t many of us back then). One day I posted a few bottles behind one of my daughters Stormtrooper toys. The following day The Balvenie Instagram account reposted that post and I saw the reaction it was getting. I thought, “I may be onto something here”. From there things just grew organically.
.
AV: What's the future of whisky look like to you?
.
BF: I love the experimentation that is going on with different casks, and finishes. It’s really giving the consumer different flavors and expressions to get excited about. But I think the future in whisky is in what you are offering at SWMS. For the enthusiast that wants to look beyond the marketing and completely geek out on a pure whisky from a single cask. It’s drams like those where you can get some unique flavors that otherwise would have been married away to reach a different flavor profile.",2017-08-22T19:24:07.000Z,Tuesday,57500,692,2,False,https://www.instagram.com/p/BYG5GkoDy1w/?taken-by=scotch_trooper,5,887,2452,night

I couldn't think of a whisky more fitting today's #SolarEclipse than the Ardbeg Dark Cove. Described as ""The Darkest Ardbeg Ever"". A perfect combo of Peat and Dark Sherry makes for just the right dram to enjoy today as we enjoy the #Eclipse. Which dram will you be enjoying today?

Mono Lake has been around for at least 760,000 years, but man dramatically altered it in under half a dozen decades. Between 1941 and 1990 Los Angeles drained Mono Lake 45 vertical feet, cutting it's volume in half. As a result, alkaline sands and formerly submerged tufa towers became exposed, the water salinity doubled, and Negit Island became a peninsula, exposing the nests of California gulls to predators (such as coyotes), and forcing the gull colony to abandon this site. Our impact on the environment is crazy when you evaluate the changes over decades or centuries. ••• Mono Lake, California

It's a constant practice to have to listen to that inner voice especially when, as a woman, everyone around you has an opinion of who or what you should be. People tell you in order to be beautiful you have to look a certain way and in order to be fit and healthy you must move a certain way. ?Living up to someone else's standards and expectations wears down on the soul. It traps you into believing less of yourself, seeing less in yourself and living below your potential.? So what if you stopped living your life trying to meet these expectations and started to define and create your own?

People edit things all the time to skew reality and they did such an incredible job keeping it REAL and authentic.

gofitjo,"""Healthy is strong. Strong is beautiful."" #qotd I'm always reminding myself with these two sentences.
???????
When I started my #fitnessjourney I wanted to become healthier, lose weight, and be thinner. It's only natural to feel this way especially when you see all these before and after photos of women who looked so much happier in their after photo. Of course I said to myself, ""She looks happy, I want that."" But then I remembered no one ever defines happiness with being thin.
???????
I woke up this morning thinking about life (like I always do) I thought about that time in high school when I used to write in my journal that I was ugly. I remember those words vividly ""You are not beautiful"" were words I scribbled over and over on pages in my notebooks, journals, and slam books. I tortured myself constantly because I had no clue what my self worth was. I was never overweight in high school, I just didn't see the beauty in myself. It wasn't until July 2013 when I knew I was finally done losing the fight I had with my mind. I had to change. I had to snap out of it and fight for my life because I dug myself into a depressive state that my daughters were soon becoming a part of.
???????
I no longer want to be an example of a woman who hates her self. I want to be an example to my girls that I am woman who loves herself enough to keep trying, to keep fighting and to continue living. My daughter once said to me, “Love is better than victory.” There are battles you will never win, but the one you should continue to fight for is love. SELF LOVE.

Women have become afraid to disrupt a system in the professional world and turn down leadership roles because of our fears of becoming less of a mother or wife in doing so. Women have become afraid of trying something new in the fear that we will look “imperfect” in the eyes of society if we fail at our own attempts.
???????
PICTURE THIS: what if we could teach our women to face that fear, to become courageous in their efforts to be brave? What if we can SHOW one another our imperfections, our courage when we fail, and our struggles to keep trying? What if we shared our struggles of the day to day as we continue to strive to disrupt society and redefine what it means to be a woman? Like the beautiful and brave @brenebrown says, “Imperfections are not inadequacies; they are reminders that we're all in this together.” #qotd
???????
If we teach our young girls to be brave, we can stand tall and proud of our imperfections. We can show them how to be bold and brave and perfect in their flaws. We can tell them its ok to embrace who we are and forgive ourselves for our mistakes. That we can build up their self-esteem, their confidence, and their ability to show compassion to others. And only in that moment can we truly feel beautiful, strong, and brave. #relentlesslybeautiful #fuckperfection

Every women needs a ""night off."" A night when they can just unwind, not put on ""real"" pants, not worry about counting macros, calories, or worry about the other lives they live. Tonight was about #selfcare and part of that practice was loving ourselves around one another. It was fucking awesome! And everything needed to push through another season of life. -

I have just learned I don't need to cover them up as heavily as I felt compelled to when I was younger. I used the @Maccosmetics Next To Nothing Face Color in Light for foundation and I am loving the light coverage. It feels great on the skin and blends beautifully with minimal effort. It is extremely hydrating and my skin feels nourished. I also applied Beaming Blush Extra Dimension Skinfinish with the 141 fan brush. The brush is perfect for applying highlight. It is dense and holds onto product well and the size is perfect for doing a quick sweep on top of the cheekbones. Beaming Blush is a gorgeous rosy pink that shifts to a lovely gold color.

darlingiknow,"I have tried a total of four times to make this look happen and finally, it came out. Sometimes my hands just don't work correctly. I used the @maccosmetics Semi-Sweet times Nine palette* to create this look. The shadows are smooth, blendable, and pigmented. I am excited for the number of transition shades I can see in this palette. On the lower lashline, I used Feline pencil, which is a bit on the stiff side for me, but worked beautifully blended out along my lower lashline for extra depth.

darlingiknow,"Do you shave your legs? Why or why not? If so, how often? I am always pumped when outfit photos show my hairy legs because it is pretty difficult to capture, but you can see it in this photo if you zoom. I DO shave my legs but only because it hurts me if I don't. I shave probably 3-4 times a year. There is a certain length the hair gets to that just...hurts me! It will get stuck in leggings and pants and the blankets brushing against my legs and night would hurt. That's when I know it is time for me to shave again! If I could go without doing it entirely, I probably would. It is just time taken out of my life that takes little tiny pieces of skin with it and I cannot get my time or skin back! I may have been shaving for the last decade and a half but I am NOT adept enough to avoid nicking myself...constantly. I used to be nervous to go out with my hairy legs, afraid of what people would think or say. I was afraid to not shave in the presence of romantic and sexual partners. I've long gotten over that. The only hurdle I need to climb now with my hairy legs is to get a pedicure. The only issue with that is that every time I have an extra $30 to spare, I want to buy glitter! ???

brodyleven,"I watched as @katieboue dug deeper than ever, cramped feet sometimes dragging under a cold sweat caught in the periphery of my dying headlamp.
She'd never climbed anything like the Grand Teton. The approach, altitude, exposure, all sharing barely a glimmer of resemblance to her years of making hard rock moves just a few feet from the ground, a short walk from her van.
This was her welcome to my world, a place I'm comfortably scared, the kind of rock climbing I know best. My annual one-man summer camp in the Tetons.
She didn't naturally excel, she struggled. Everyone does. It's hard. Safe and efficient expediency had never been rewarded in her climbing career. Suddenly, it was all that mattered. Beta, advice, back-seat-driving came to her constantly in the form of my two cents. She was receptive, collected, calm in her position as not only teammate, not only girlfriend, but follower.
Katie reached the summit after climbing the Petzoldt Ridge and Upper Exum. I helped her get there, yes. But I didn't ""take her up"" the route. She walked to it. She climbed it. She carried her own pack from the car that morning and back to it that afternoon.
Standing on top, yes, she was happy. But what she doesn't understand is how much she offered me before and after the summit. The slugs, the ravens, the sounds. She notices, appreciates, is struck by it all.
See, I know how it feels to climb to and stand on summits. What I don't always appreciate is the process, the long approach, the insects. She opened my eyes.
Before we started, one of my countless comments was to ""remember, it's not a hike, it's an approach. We aren't picking dandelions, we're carrying packs to the base of a climbing route, and that's why we're there."" Deeply inspired as I watched her push herself on the hardest day of her life, she taught me that you can do both.",2017-09-08T04:22:50.000Z,Friday,50900,162,0,False,https://www.instagram.com/p/BYxDeRyH59V/?taken-by=brodyleven,1,1342,1535,night
brodyleven,"As a kid, winter was IT. All I wanted. My season.
I rented skis for most of my childhood in Ohio, but finally started getting my own cheap gear as a young teenager. At garage sales and end-of-season ski sales I found discounted demo skis, but it meant impatiently waiting until NEXT WINTER to use them. To curb my enthusiasm, I’d spend days walking around the house in full ski gear—boots stomping on wood floors, goggles on a sweaty forehead, tripping on oversized snow pants mid-summer. I would jump up and imitate the spins that I saw in ski movies and magazines. All I wanted was to ski in the Big Rocky Mountains Out West, to use next year’s ski gear, to befriend the pros, to challenge myself in terrain I didn’t know.
Fast forward 15 years, and the season’s first issue of @powdermagazine shows up in my Salt Lake City mailbox. It’s outside a home that I own, paid for by my skiing. It’s all come true. A picture in a ski magazine full of pictures. But this one is of me. A magazine I was on the cover of last year. Taken by @adambarkerphotography, a ski photographer whose name I knew but I never thought would waste time shooting this Ohio boy, let alone befriend. Climbing up and skiing down mountains bigger than anything I’d ever seen or dreamed of while stomping around my living room with a seasons-old jacket. All of this in the year’s first issue of the skier’s bible, the annual signal of an imminent season change, the stoker of stoke.
It worked, both the stoke and the dream.",2017-09-07T03:47:06.000Z,Thursday,50900,162,0,False,https://www.instagram.com/p/BYualp9nkE2/?taken-by=brodyleven,2,1342,2442,night
brodyleven,"Last time I saw one of these, my toes got frostbite. For the first time. @chrisrubens, @codytownsend and I stood on a breezy ridgeline while (PC) @reubenkrabbe and @anthonybonello shot a timelapse for @salomonfreeski from below, not far from the edge of the frozen ocean sea ice.
We were in Svalbard, a Norwegian island far into the Arctic. It's the northernmost inhabited land in the world, and Reuben, a photographic visionary, knew what was possible. It was winter, months before most skiers would consider visiting the Arctic. For weeks, we camped on a glacier, climbing and skiing mountains on the Arctic Ocean coastline, fearing polar bears at night and experiencing windchill down to -40 in the day.
Looking back on videos from that trip (never-before-seen raw POV video in my bio today), I feel closer to the people I experienced it with. I can't explain. It was profound. I freaked out.
You might, too.
For your own sake, witness this tomorrow.
Take the day off, drive 11 hours, do whatever it takes.
Get the glasses and watch the eclipse.
------------
PSA: Understand totality vs less.
Without eclipse glasses, ""95% eclipsed"" will look like 0%. If the sun is showing even a bit, all you’ll see during the eclipse is the sun--you know, the bright thing you can't look at. If 1% of it is showing, it just looks like the sun. (Without glasses,) you will not see an eclipse. You will see the sun. If you live somewhere the eclipse will be at 91%, it is not 91% of the experience of those traveling to the path of the totality. I promise.
I didn't think the eclipse would be too cool. I was wrong. It was one of the wildest visual experiences of my life and I can’t encourage you enough to do whatever you can to make sure you experience the totality of this. And if you can’t see the totality, find yourself some eclipse glasses. And don’t be surprised if someone near you starts crying.

brodyleven,"Every couple of weeks, I remember I have earrings. They’re gauged a bit, and I got them pierced at age 15. I don’t even know why I still have them. I hated Salt Lake when I moved here for college. My university was too small, I wasn’t meeting the right people, but most of all—I wasn’t skiing. In fact, it was 100 degrees. I’d expected to move Out West and ski every day. Turns out, August in Utah is hot, not the glacial Rocky Mountain High life I’d anticipated. People told me to just breathe, meet more people, start rock climbing to keep my mind off skiing, give it a chance, and wait it out until winter. I did, and 11 years later I’m still here. In fact, rock climbing instantly became such a big part of my life that I traveled around the world doing it, started liking it as much as skiing, and quickly combined them into ski mountaineering, which is what I now do for a living. I know the pro skier thing is hard to grasp: I don’t have Olympic aspirations, my sport isn’t even an event. Heck, I don’t even compete. After asking those questions, most people follow up with, “Oh, so you’re a ski instructor.” No, I don’t have a traditional job. As my own brand, I’m a marketing asset and provide content for brands appealing to the outdoor industry. I’m not a slalom skier and I’ll never win a medal. I go into the mountains most days and travel the world on a shoestring, pushing myself in a variety of ways that allow me to return with stories which inspire people to challenge themselves. Some brands are down with that, others aren’t. I don’t have direct bosses telling me what to do. I’ve never worked in a corporate office or had an Outlook account. But like you, I work hard. I have retirement accounts, a licensed business, and do bookkeeping. I feel like I’m spread thin and like there aren’t enough hours in the day. I have loads of self-doubt. I’m self-employed, self-motivated, but hopefully not only self-serving.

brodyleven,"(""About,"" continued). I’m a lifelong vegetarian, thanks to my parents. Last week, at a red light, I rolled down my window and asked the couple in the 12-foot-tall 2017 pickup truck next to me why they modified their truck to blow pollution out the tailpipe. At the next light, I explained how we all—including their children—live with the consequences of their choices. I like bikepacking. I grew up in Ohio and worked very hard to become a professional skier; specially, I focus on ski mountaineering with an emphasis on year-round mountain endurance sports. That is my job. Social media is not how I make a living. I do not have a trust fund. Instead, I work hard to build relationships with brands like @salomonfreeski, @garmin, and @goalzero. Funds I earned from a small business I started at a young age put me through a New England ski academy in high school and then through college. I never skied west of Indiana until I moved to Utah in 2006. My family doesn’t ski. I wear size 27 pants, which aren't made for men. I have a hard time pronouncing my own name. I don't have a good or consistent signature. I have overdeveloped quadriceps and underdeveloped everything else. Except my head, which is huge. I’ve never been able to find a haircut that really works for me. I keep things in my life very clean, tidy, and organized—from my car to my tent, bed sheets to closet.

brodyleven,"Maybe you've asked a lot of yourself this year, month, or just today.
Do you reward yourself for it?
This spring and summer, I've asked a lot of my body. Mostly my feet. I frostbit the heck outta them while skiing and ice climbing in Alaska last April. A month later, I hiked 60 miles in unsupportive rubber rain boots through the Ugandan jungle during rainy season. In June, I ran and trained my little heart out, celebrating what I thought was cured frostbite. In July, I destroyed them in a 100-mile Lake Tahoe running race. And now, in August, I keep cramming them and their dried-up blisters into climbing shoes in the summer heat. But this is still a reward, both to myself and my feet. Because what I do each day is a gift I can give my health--mental and physical. To be happy, I HAVE to mix it up.
I ask a lot of my body and my schedule. Maybe you ask a lot of your limited sleep, your spouse, your fitness, your bank account, or your skill set. I think it's important to acknowledge that and then reward it. Take a day off, hire a trainer, go to the beach, cook dinner, or try an easy trad route instead of going back to that project.
And if it means riding downhill trails on dropbars, that'll work, too.

brodyleven,"So many of us have had injuries. After my second recent frostbite incident, a lot of you hit me up about your own injuries. I feel for you. They all suck. I’ve broken, torn, sprained, and concussed so much of my body over the years, mostly from soccer and skiing. April's Alaskan frostbite took me out of training for over a month. For me, this means a month of feeling unfulfilled.
But in May, I was able to hike and ski in Africa without major incident. Climbing 5.9 at 17,000 feet on Mt. Kenya probably would have been more relaxed in climbing shoes, but I stubbornly left my @salomon approach shoes on—jamming and smearing in them—to avoid learning if my toes were ready for the constraints of climbing shoes. The same went for running: I didn’t try any long runs because I was nervous my frostbite would be aggravated and I'd have to face the reality of my condition. I stopped being nervous two weeks ago, and ran a 100-mile race. On both occasions, my toes weren’t comfortable, but they were ready to be tested. And though some pain interfered, they passed.
I’m getting better. The frostbite is healing. Some people messaged me about their torn ACL’s, others about far more serious conditions. None of them are favorable, but all are part of life.
I want my body to function more like a machine than a flimsy skin suit. Getting sweaty outside on a daily basis is the only strategy I have. My physical fitness isn’t some aspect of a bigger sense of fulfillment these days, but a direct shot to my core happiness. This makes injuries even harder to handle. But the messages from you helped me put things in perspective, and I’m just happy to finally be running and rock climbing again.

the.naked.soul,"You should never assume people need your help (unless they explicitly ask for help). Those who are in pain or need some help usually find a way to either ask or drop hints. Yet, do not push or force your solution to their problem. Do not assume your solution is the ""best"" for them. (Specially, if the receiver is not ready to receive help and feels uncomfortable with your proposal). They know their situation better.
Another thing is, unless someone truly wants to overcome their problems, you can't really help them. Help is offered with compassion and love. Genuine help is offered in the terms of the asker fitting to their timing and with their willingness.

the.naked.soul,"I lost my father to cancer this March. When I first heard he was diagnosed with stage IV stomach cancer, I was shattered. I packed my suitcase and flew. I found my father confused, physically exhausted and week, and depressed. After all, he was only 59. My mom was on her way. I watched all the documentaries I could find on Cancer. I read as many books I could find on Cancer. I devoured the Internet, YouTube, everything. We contact everyone from quake to shamans to spiritualists to plain old scam doctors with miracle cure. We tried everything because we had nothing to lose. The doctors had already given up on my dad. But we haven't. And he was willing to fight. He was still in the denial phase, questioning why he had got the cancer on the first place. He was a good and lively man who lived freely and made everyone smile and laugh around him. He never smoked or drank. He had decent diet, he was physically active. He wasn't suppose to have stomach cancer. But here was was, with cancer and physically, emotionally, mentally weak and broken. This was very painful to watch. Not that I am a small kid but if you want to know what real suffering is, I can tell you something.
Real suffering is watching other people suffer and not able to do anything about it. He wanted to live. And here we were, all of us, and our science and our Gods, but no one was able to do anything. It was only 48 days. From my suitcase to throwing the ashes of my fathers body into the river Ganga. I was in the deep agony myself. I was SO fixated on the ""death"". Cancer, death, uncertainty, luck, fear, these were the state of my existence.
But I learned something in those 48 days. Those 48 days with my father taught me about life, first hand. I lived through what it really means ti have the mindset of ""being alive"". What would you do if this was your last day? If this was your last month? If this was your 48 days? If this was your last year? What the f@ck would you do?

I learned Cancer was not about ""death"". It was actually about ""life."" After all, the dreaded death that we fear so much is about LIFE. It is for life and the light of life that we fear the death.

I was going to start vlogging again but I can’t legally unless I get filming insurance and go through sag. Sometimes I go through depression. I feel hopeless and sad.

Stefan Lessard is not only a great photographer he is a wonderful person. Time, is something we never have enough of and this meet was no exception, however, we had the privilege to shoot him with a group of musicians he helped put together for a free concert to spread awareness of ways to solve environmental challenges. Keeping the environment clean benefits us all.
What a great night! It's exactly what Kathy and I needed! This pic says it all!
Oh did I mention that Stefan is an awesome musician too! ?

""My English is getting worse if I compare it to university...but I communicate better than ever w/ locals here because I use concrete words just to communicate.
The food is amazing but very heavy/savory.
Nothing has a fixed price...not even food so you really have to pay attention & be ready to bargain.
.
Southern India was slow & the people were relaxed. The North has bigger cities, is tough & people move faster. It's a hustle to get around but it makes you soooo grateful when you arrive at your destination lol
( @uber exists here y'all) ???
The streets are crowded w/ the most colorful fabrics, clothing, jewelry, gurus, camels, honking Tuk Tuks & merchants.??
//
It's overwhelming at times so I've learned to breakdown things into sections, look deeper at smaller aspects of the city & focus on the people I'm with.
People here help us w/ out even knowing our names...
All of my assumptions about this space are wrong...& that is ok....
---
I'm growing?. I'm changing?. I'm learning not to form opinions immediately?.
I say yes before thinking no & learn to find positivity in even the most culturally ""different"" situations.

Stay tuned for more of my thoughts on #india ??

Words or photos honestly can't describe or show exactly how it feels to stand directly below a total solar eclipse and stare at it looking down on you like an ominous black eye. @karl_shakur and I ventured to Grand Teton National Park to witness this once in a lifetime opportunity to see the moon's shadow pass directly over the Tetons. For a little over 2 minutes the culmination of years of planning and excitement came to an epic head and just like that, it was over.
I think this may be the start to much more eclipse chasing in my future. •

Not only do I have the original photo to work off of, but the talented illustrator Alex Kim of @akimdesigns created an amazing sketch of it as well, which I plan on printing out and framing. If you are like me, and get stoked to see an outfit you've created come to life in the form of art, then you are in luck! There are now new shoppable fashion sketches available on @eBay (link in bio) and you all have the chance to be sketched and win a $100 eBay gift card! Just add a comment to one of your favorite IG fashion looks using @eBay, #MyFashionWeek and #sweepstakes to enter. ??

OEQ ??: Im not actually in Alaska at the moment, I'm just on my couch with my pup @lil_leleu laying on me... I was told that the perception people have of me is that I'm ""Always on top of mountains""... Which is cool to think that when people think of me they think of mountains... but you have to understand that what is shown on social media is NOT always real life. The moments are typically curated moments captured that represent the peak of experiences. I just think it's good to remind people of that from time to time :)

OEQ ??: I know I'd get more likes and comments and all that jazz if I posted more shirtless selfies or modeling photos... And that's all well and good, but I just can't bring myself to only share a single dimension of my personality just because I receive more ""positive"" feedback on it. I believe that all the little and trivial things we do in life add up over time to be much bigger and more important things. So that's why I believe it's very important to express yourself as a multi-dimensional being (not talking about crazy sci-fi things here). Share your ups, share your downs, share your selfies, and share your perspectives. If you do all of that you're putting out an image of yourself that's more true than just doing one of those things. You're being human... and that's valuable and inspirational. So be you, be real, and do cool things!

himichiandco,"Good morning! It's been fa-eva since I've introduced myself.
I'm Michi Moore and I'm a Disney world addict, dog mom, and super Sia fan.

Born and raised in the south, and filled with wanderlust, I’m a lover, giver, and endless optimist.
But I will go to war for those I believe in.

I carry with me the lessons of my angels and mothers and fight for those who will come after me. And because of that, I have learned the enormous power of forgiveness.

I’m a student of the Course In Miracles and learn more about myself and those around me every single day.

After realizing that my innate desire to be the best was intertwined with some outrageous anxiety, I became determined to be a part of the solution: to bring more awareness to what anxiety disorders really are and how to deal with them in your own way.

To sum it all up, I’m just Michi (ME-she). Nice to meet you.",2017-04-14T12:36:07.000Z,Friday,36900,469,0,False,https://www.instagram.com/p/BS3bEirg1tw/?taken-by=himichiandco,0,1114,233,midday

For the last 3 years I wanted to have the opportunity to serve more and to give more and I feel like I'm one more step along thay journey.

I'm not going to lie, I felt so jealous when I would see someone else achieving my dream, until I had to shut my self up.

I had to do what I helped other women achieve.

I had to start doing.

himichiandco,"The one thing you don't realize is how good you've got it. This past quarter has been one filled with the most dynamic growth I have ever experienced.

And every day I'm exceedingly grateful.

If I didn't have the business I've set up, I would have had a completely different experience.

I'm a very private person when going though something I can't see the end of. If I can't see the why, I shut down.

I don't want to be a complainer.
I don't want pitty.
I don't want to be a party pooper, especially when I'm trying so hard to cultivate a space filled with positive energy.

But now.
Now I know.

I had a vision for what I wanted to be able to do and I let myself get in the way.

So I started writing, compiling my research, and putting my own advice into action.

Then, I got sick.... really sick. And that meant I had a ton of time on my hands. Like a month and a half worth of time. It blew up every timetable i had. Every plan i made, then i realized (again) that everything happens for a reason.

My desire since the very beginning was to offer real, live, actionable resources for as many women as possible. That was the desire from the even the first conversation i had with @bellestrategies.

So i made it happen.

I decided to make it happen.

I've seen her come home after a 12-hour shift, dead tired after dealing with an abusive patient all day, and get back up and do it again the next day. She's come home after holding a baby in her hands and watching it take their last breath. She's saved a drug addicts life after overdosing in the hospital bed.

stapaw,"MY TATTOO STORY: ""I got the semi colon tattoo to represent the fact that my story isn't finished and the butterfly tattoo is remembering my grandmother who passed away. My job let me go the next day, because of my tattoo. The kicker is my tattoo didn't even show when I wore my work uniform. Customers could only see it when I left or came to work."" These are the types of stories @STAPAW hears daily at the tent. Thank you to everyone who helps us cast light on this. Like if you agree her tattoo isn't inappropriate for the workplace!

We're alway looking for new ways to improve and maintain the badger's health, so we just had to try out these pawsome products from Canna-Pet. After all, this badger isn't getting any younger! The badger gobbled down the treats as soon as they were in front of his face - needless to say, he finds them pretty tasty. With the supplement, I just put it on a treat with peanut butter or open the capsule to sprinkle on his meal. Quick and easy! Besides all the nutritional and health benefits, we are happy to support such a great organization that uses science and natural resources to improve the well-being of all dogs! If you have a moment, be sure to check them out. ??
